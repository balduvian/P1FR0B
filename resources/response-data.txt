antimage, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, 207
antimage, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, 208
antimage, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, 209
antimage, the antimage has arrived, 210
antimage, im wei we can get to know each other better after i kill these guys, 211
antimage, ive been training for this moment, 212
antimage, i wont fail you, 213
antimage, i wont let my mentor down, 214
antimage, together we can bring an end to magic, 215
antimage, i have my orders, 216
antimage, my life doesnt matter the mission does, 217
antimage, im here on behalf of the tyler estate, 218
antimage, run mages run, 219
antimage, run mages run, 220
antimage, breathe wei breathe its just an army no big deal, 221
antimage, no turning back now, 222
antimage, lets show them who theyre dealing with, 223
antimage, ill show them what ive learned, 224
antimage, this is the moment ive been waiting for, 225
antimage, i can almost taste the anticipation in the wind, 226
antimage, we dont have much time we need a plan, 227
antimage, now is the time for action, 228
antimage, we will fight and we will win, 229
antimage, i have trained for this moment and i am ready, 230
antimage, the antimage trained me molded me i will make him proud, 231
antimage, ive waited so long for this moment to prove not just to my mentor but to the world what im capable of, 232
antimage, theres no magi that i cant track and kill, 233
antimage, the antimage and i are similar but we do have differences for instance i know how to talk like a normal person, 234
antimage, ive dedicated my life to be good at one thing hunting mages, 235
antimage, war of the ancients tss please ive had to conduct an investigation in weeping rose theres nothing scary about some glowy rocks, 236
antimage, i dont look forward to bloodshed but im not afraid of it either, 237
antimage, the antimage is not a name it is a title worthy of respect from the righteous and fear from the wicked, 238
antimage, vanessa once told me that the antimage is just using me, 239
antimage, which isnt surprising shes a wizard lying comes easy for their kind, 240
antimage, i know exactly who and what the antimage is a man consumed, 241
antimage, but even in his dedication and pursuit he never once presumed to have control over me theres a reason he insists i call him mentor not master, 242
antimage, he knows why i sought him out and he knows that my path isnt his, 243
antimage, like any father he has dreams of what i can become, 244
antimage, and like any daughter i want to make him proud but i need to do it on my terms, 245
antimage, i cant stress how much i hate blink daggers, 246
antimage, like i spent years learning how to transport through space by sheer power of will and then i found out you can just go to a damn store and buy a blink dagger, 247
antimage, and by the way it doesnt even really look like a dagger its more like a swirly hatchet thing that spits in the face of my training, 248
antimage, once i brought this up to the antimage and all he had to say about it was you should be meditating, 249
antimage, which is this whole other problem because meditation is just not my thing, 250
antimage, anyway blink daggers i hate them, 251
antimage, a war is coming and i will be ready, 252
antimage, though youd think id be getting ready by training or sharpening my blades or ya know doing something other than sitting and trying not to think about anything which im totally screwing up and bleh alright starting over, 253
antimage, hiii huuh my blades are an extension of my hands my hands an extension of my will, 254
antimage, my emotions are a reflection of my actions not the driver of them, 255
antimage, my mind is focused real focused like really focused you wouldnt believe how focused my damn it i lost it ok one more time, 256
antimage, my blades are an extension of my hands my hands are an extension of my will my emotions are a reflection of my actions not the driver of them and my mind is focused on the task at hand because a divided mind is a weak mind this is the creed of the antimage this is the law of the hunt boom, 257
antimage, and now i wait until im needed, 258
antimage, which can happen any time, 259
antimage, like anytime at all, 260
antimage, like if someone needed help with the war of the ancients i would be so ready, 261
antimage, just say the word, 262
antimage, please, 263
antimage, i should have brought a book, 264
antimage, im ready, 265
antimage, im ready, 266
antimage, oh thank god, 267
antimage, ugh thank god, 268
antimage, iwasntasleep, 269
antimage, imreadyletsgo, 270
antimage, wu ay huh, 271
antimage, the antimage says i survived for days before he found me, 272
antimage, hed stumbled across the remains of my caravan, 273
antimage, on the trail of the things that took my kin, 274
antimage, he was younger full of fire looking for a fight not a child, 275
antimage, i dont remember much but i do remember the first moment i saw him, 276
antimage, he likes to tell me that all he did was lend a hand that i would have survived without his help, 277
antimage, growing up i even used to believe him, 278
antimage, but ive seen what the world makes of lost children, 279
antimage, some call the antimage heartless a monster i know better, 280
antimage, he found a place for me and when i was old enough a place beside him to learn more than just how to survive, 281
antimage, together well beat back the darkness that threatens to make lost children of us all, 282
antimage, the other children at the sanctuary didnt really take to me, 283
antimage, i mean i can see why i was insufferable i had a destiny i had a mentor waiting for me, 284
antimage, and when i was old enough which always seemed just a day or two away i would seek him out and do great things, 285
antimage, can you imagine living with that so what if it was true they hated me, 286
antimage, humility is something that came later well lets call it a work in progress, 287
antimage, i won some of them over in the end kinda well lets call that a work in progress too, 288
antimage, i dont remember much about my family, 289
antimage, i dont remember anything about the day i lost them, 290
antimage, just what the antimage told me, 291
antimage, he says im better off, 292
antimage, seeing who he is what hes become hes probably right, 293
antimage, but that doesnt stop me from wanting to know needing to know, 294
antimage, and when my trainings complete hell owe me more than a childrens story, 295
antimage, hell owe me the truth, 296
antimage, alright wei dont embarrass yourself, 297
antimage, ok here we go, 298
antimage, wow that was louder than i thought it be, 299

antimage, my will is strong, 367
antimage, i wont succumb to magic, 368
antimage, youre not as powerful as you thought, 369
antimage, youll have to try harder than that, 370
antimage, you think a couple cantrips are gonna stop me, 371
antimage, counter magic was my first lesson and i learned it well, 372
antimage, not so fast, 373
antimage, i wont be broken by magic, 374
antimage, your tricks wont work on me, 375
antimage, it will take more than that magi, 376
antimage, you have no power over me, 377

antimage, let the void consume you, 385
antimage, you will be destroyed by your own magic, 386
antimage, its over, 387
antimage, say goodnight, 388
antimage, you brought this on yourself, 389

antimage, more training never hurts, 394

earthshaker, youll find no safe soil here, 1034
earthshaker, who gave you permission to prance across the earth, 1035
earthshaker, no longer will your hooves dig into my hide, 1036

earthshaker, consider me the mountain part two, 1055
earthshaker, you werent taking me seriously, 1056
earthshaker, looks like you ran into a wall, 1057
earthshaker, youve corrupted your last innocent mireska, 1058
earthshaker, you could have avoided this fate, 1059
earthshaker, you embody much of what mars this universe, 1060
earthshaker, no one will mourn you, 1061
earthshaker, god of war meet rock of ages, 1062
earthshaker, you think a puny wall can keep me out, 1063

earthshaker, you would have been much better off fighting by my side, 1080
earthshaker, trunk dunk, 1081
earthshaker, this is what comes from leaving the hive, 1082
earthshaker, they spoke of your arrival but now i see you on your way, 1083
earthshaker, i had hoped to learn from you all youve shown me is how to fail, 1084
earthshaker, you chose the wrong master, 1085
earthshaker, you should have stayed in your earth warren, 1086
earthshaker, the earth will miss you brother bear, 1087
earthshaker, plant these vile things somewhere else, 1088
earthshaker, the earth doesnt appreciate your machinations, 1089
earthshaker, i told you to stop digging around here, 1090
earthshaker, there seem to be more everytime i look fine by me, 1091
earthshaker, you make such a tempting treat, 1092
earthshaker, oh ho ho i live for that, 1093
earthshaker, youre master of nothing but your own demise, 1094

earthshaker, i needed a pickmeup, 1109
earthshaker, thisll be a jump up, 1110
earthshaker, this is no time to stay down, 1111
earthshaker, this is no time to stay grounded, 1112
earthshaker, earth meet sky, 1113
earthshaker, weve got all the right moves, 1114
earthshaker, they cannot shake us from this course, 1115
earthshaker, i knew we would turn things around, 1116
earthshaker, i have every confidence but lets not get ahead of ourselves, 1117
earthshaker, an unfortunate reversal of fortune but we can still outwit them, 1118
earthshaker, we cannot let recent events muddy our prospects its time to dig in, 1119
earthshaker, i havent lost hope as long as i breathe i will make the enemy fear me, 1120
earthshaker, even if i fall the earth remains might others live to defend her i will hope that is enough, 1121
earthshaker, shitty wizard, 1122
earthshaker, ive heard whispers of the wizards return, 1123
earthshaker, earthshaker, 1124
earthshaker, earthshaker here, 1125
earthshaker, feel the earth shake, 1126
earthshaker, quiver and quake, 1127
earthshaker, shake it, 1128
earthshaker, grounded, 1129
earthshaker, the earth shakes and the cosmos reverberates, 1130
earthshaker, mountains fall before me what chance have you, 1131
earthshaker, always have i felt the earth but now something else beckons, 1132
earthshaker, now a turning point in the cosmic journey, 1133
earthshaker, ill find a way through this because i must too much remains unanswered, 1134
earthshaker, this is not the only earth that needs me, 1135
earthshaker, it was earth but it was not our earth and now it is a part of me, 1136
earthshaker, i cannot say now where it came from but i can feel the place, 1137
earthshaker, i know that somewhere across distances i cannot describe a world ended, 1138
earthshaker, and i know that this world ended in great pain, 1139
earthshaker, i know there are lines that must not be crossed and someone has crossed them, 1140
earthshaker, i cannot undo what has been done i cannot save those who were lost but i will learn how to cross such great distances and avenge the wrongs done my sister earth, 1141
earthshaker, this i know, 1142
earthshaker, i am changing no i am changed with what more to come, 1143
earthshaker, i felt something in the first days even before the visions arrived, 1144
earthshaker, but the onset of the dreamsor should i say memoriesdrove that other strange feeling from my mind, 1145
earthshaker, now there are changes too striking to ignore, 1146
earthshaker, and i can only wonder what will my sister earth make of me, 1147
earthshaker, something is coming i cannot name it but i know it holds hostility in its heart, 1148
earthshaker, i know i have met this entity before in another life, 1149
earthshaker, i did not live to tell the tale, 1150
earthshaker, but i did pass something on for here i stand, 1151
earthshaker, this time i shall not falter i will not fall, 1152
earthshaker, i still live the strange memories i carry still remain, 1153
earthshaker, the travelertrespasserwill never leave this earth but he is not unique, 1154
earthshaker, there are others of his kind who share blame for the death of my sister earth and perhaps countless other worlds bereft of champions, 1155
earthshaker, for all my abilities i have much to learn when these wounds have healed or grown over i must find a greater power and venture away from my beloved soil, 1156
earthshaker, the cosmic dreams reveal aspects of the path but the rest is up to me, 1157
earthshaker, i will not rest the fates of many worlds rest in these hands, 1158
earthshaker, my thanks, 1159
earthshaker, the earth thanks you, 1160
earthshaker, let me shake your hand, 1161
earthshaker, alls well, 1162

earthshaker, they strike, 1168
earthshaker, ill watch the brains ooze out the side of your shattered skull, 1169
earthshaker, the more the merrier, 1170
earthshaker, it will take more than that to shake the earthshaker, 1171
earthshaker, i wont dignify that with a response, 1172
earthshaker, thatll shake your confidence, 1173
earthshaker, i cant tell you how upset this makes me, 1174
earthshaker, the earth remembers friend the earth remembers, 1175
earthshaker, the earth goes on it will not remember you, 1176
earthshaker, shake it up baby, 1177

mirana, blood magic is difficult to trust, 646
mirana, we never think ourselves evil but how does one argue with this, 647
mirana, i should buy a pair for marci otherwise they do me no good, 648
mirana, why was i so drawn to this, 649
mirana, i could almost forget im an archer, 650
mirana, i thought this was simple snake oil until i experienced the effects, 651
mirana, i was told you never charged for this, 652
mirana, cant the courier make its own way, 653
mirana, what am i thinking, 654
mirana, they will bleed for this, 655
mirana, i never wanted such power but i wont waste this, 656
mirana, they will suffer horribly though mine is a righteous path, 657
mirana, victory here is worth any price, 658
mirana, will they remember only my cruelty, 659
mirana, let them try to interfere, 660
mirana, the enemy forces my hand, 661
mirana, even at that range its wise to trust my bow, 662
mirana, i would have preferred chimes, 663
mirana, i should have carried this back in nightsilver, 664
mirana, i had hoped to be worthy of this, 665
mirana, it has an abnormal heft, 666
mirana, ive been underequipped before it wont happen again, 667
mirana, id wager davion still fills his with stronger stuff, 668
mirana, it unsettles me greatly to toy with the veil of death, 669
mirana, judging by the scepter eul was a craftsman of unerring taste, 670
mirana, if this is of fae origin whats the hidden price, 671
mirana, we can aid others as well as ourselves, 672
mirana, not this bloody thing, 673
mirana, there are times retreating into shadow isnt enough, 674
mirana, a childs plaything when compared to nightsilvers gifts, 675
mirana, it degrades me to scrounge for scraps, 676
mirana, good enough for scrapes and bruises, 677
mirana, almost as strong as a dead gods heart, 678
mirana, heavens halberd, 679
mirana, id rather have loyalty than control, 680
mirana, i wonder which deity gave blessings to this, 681
mirana, anything that wizards hate is acceptable to me, 682
mirana, hurricane pike, 683
mirana, this will speed us towards the end, 684
mirana, i admire its simplicity, 685
mirana, they may already be prepared for this, 686
mirana, kaya, 687
mirana, kaya and sange, 688
mirana, a lesser lotus but helpful all the same, 689
mirana, maelstrom, 690
mirana, i find safety in the storm, 691
mirana, a crude essential, 692
mirana, it seems that three of us might get something done, 693
mirana, i should be careful dont want to end up like traxex, 694
mirana, who couldnt use a little boost, 695
mirana, if anyone is wounded send them to me, 696
mirana, what are the origins of this, 697
mirana, mjollnir, 698
mirana, does this belong to that insufferable monkey, 699
mirana, i feel honored, 700
mirana, i shouldnt look, 701
mirana, its just something to start with, 702
mirana, with the proper tools anything can be killed, 703
mirana, i prefer to see where im going, 704
mirana, intriguing id heard these were dangerous magics, 705
mirana, the smallest edge might be all it takes, 706
mirana, im at the edge sagan help me not fall off, 707
mirana, standard issue boots, 708
mirana, ive never cared for the types of insight found in pipes, 709
mirana, im not indecisive im adaptable, 710
mirana, it may be useful but cant marci carry this, 711
mirana, as long as it doesnt singe sagan, 712
mirana, for when they make me repeat myself, 713
mirana, ill keep it as a fallback plan, 714
mirana, sange, 715
mirana, sange and yasha, 716
mirana, does this make me a monster, 717
mirana, if only it revealed ill intentions, 718
mirana, it dehumanizes me to even use it, 719
mirana, ill stay warm with the help of sagan, 720
mirana, this is a monarchs nightmare, 721
mirana, the famed eye of skadi, 722
mirana, this stuff is a fallback at best, 723
mirana, i feel a strange connection, 724
mirana, this will give sagan a chance, 725
mirana, this spirit vessel will sing to them, 726
mirana, i read this in one of my fathers libraries, 727
mirana, oh i guess id forgotten that bit, 728
mirana, this one covers the helio imperium filled with inaccuracies of course, 729
mirana, its not very dignified but im learning to adapt to a lot of new things, 730
mirana, if aghanim wont guard his power then its mine to claim, 731
mirana, let wicked souls not go to waste, 732
mirana, i seize a vanguards might, 733
mirana, veil of discord, 734
mirana, i pray that i live to regret this, 735
mirana, yasha, 736
mirana, yasha and kaya, 737

mirana, where did this one come from ive never heard of it, 747
mirana, i couldnt understand what i was missing, 748
mirana, i wasnt sure i could even lift this, 749

mirana, this is the strength of the helio imperium, 823
mirana, the eye of the world wyrm gives me strength, 824
mirana, i shall reach my full potential, 825
mirana, i have so much potential, 826
mirana, what is this power, 827
mirana, i will rival selemene, 828
mirana, as bright as the moon as radiant as the sun, 829
mirana, davion isnt the only one with suprises, 830
mirana, learning more about myself every day, 831
mirana, my power continues to grow, 832
mirana, ill learn to control my gifts, 833
mirana, like father like daughter, 834
mirana, they wont find me easy pray, 835
mirana, you feel that too sagan, 836
mirana, we shall rise to meet any challenge, 837
mirana, my will shall not be broken, 838
mirana, how embaressing, 839
mirana, fymryn is going to rub this in i know it, 840
mirana, there has to be a way to fix this, 841
mirana, i i lost, 842
mirana, the invoker is to blame for this im sure of it, 843
mirana, i can almost hear selemene laughing at me, 844
mirana, is this what the oracles prophacy was leading towards, 845
mirana, i thought i was destined for so much more, 846
mirana, missing top, 847
mirana, missing middle, 848
mirana, missing bottom, 849
mirana, i think about my father often, 850
mirana, he was a good man an honorable man, 851
mirana, and gods know a patient man, 852
mirana, to be honest i was a bit of a terror when i was younger, 853
mirana, and while i imagine thats true of most children i was a special brand of spoiled and entitled, 854
mirana, i try not to dwell on it, 855
mirana, but there are nights when i cant help but think that my father died when i was at my worst, 856
mirana, and hell never be able to see me at my best, 857
mirana, the invoker keeps trying to tell people that selemene is a gaslighting sociopath which is just patently ridiculous, 858
mirana, did she encourage luna to murder a tribe of elves just because they wouldnt revere her as a god sure but, 859
mirana, ok yeah that does sound pretty bad maybe invoker was onto something, 860
mirana, im past relying on lotuses for power, 861
mirana, unless of course i deside to buy a lotus orb, 862
mirana, in which case i would in fact be relying on a lotus for power but that doesnt really count because in that instance, 863
mirana, im an adult woman deciding how to spend my hard earned coin as opposed to a lost small child whose mother was killed in a coup and found a way to fill the gaping void in her heart by allowing herself to be pressed into service by a goddess who would weaponize the devotion of said girl by posing as a mother figure and man the more im talking the more it makes me realize i was in a moon cult, 864
mirana, davion was talking in his sleep the other night, 865
mirana, i swear to the gods he was dreaming that he was kadens sidekick, 866
mirana, it was adorable, 867
mirana, marcis quite fond of wei, 868
mirana, watching them train together laugh together start a bar fight together, 869
mirana, it was a joy to see, 870
mirana, she was by my side for so long i think we both forgot who we were as individuals, 871
mirana, she deserves to be her own person, 872
mirana, she deserves to live a life free of my shadow, 873
mirana, we slip into shadow, 874
mirana, hidden even from the brightest light, 875
mirana, i fear nothing that moves in the night, 876
mirana, we bathe in mystic light, 877
mirana, all i can give us is a chance, 878
mirana, only the wary might find us, 879
mirana, step softly and leave no trace, 880
mirana, raise no hand in anger and youll pass from sight, 881
mirana, stay silent and move quickly, 882
mirana, its time, 883
mirana, we cant let them see us, 884
mirana, i trust everyone was out of sight, 885

puck, shortlived creatures, 23
puck, they deserve no less, 24
puck, destroy, 25
puck, they shall regret this, 26

puck, i have much to impart, 28
puck, dont run, 29
puck, stay and amuse me, 30

puck, aw, 60
puck, aw, 61
puck, strange transformation, 62
puck, taken before my time, 63
puck, no, 64
puck, let the world end now it matters not to me, 65
puck, your actions are without merit, 66
puck, i do not comprehend, 67
puck, grievous misunderstanding, 68
puck, why, 69
puck, this changes nothing, 70
puck, a midsummer nightmare, 71
puck, it is no great matter, 72
puck, get up if you can, 73
puck, what ingratitude, 74
puck, will you not rise in my presence, 75
puck, presumably a pity, 76
puck, see you in the spring, 77
puck, a strange time to hibernate, 78
puck, thats for your impertinence, 79
puck, you took that jape too far, 80
puck, you might wish to retract your last move, 81
puck, may you ride on nether zephyrs, 82
puck, fresh from deaths chrysalis, 83
puck, that was an exceedingly odd metamorphosis, 84
puck, i had not expected to be reborn for another million years, 85
puck, ah nothing like the feel of a fresh molt, 86
puck, someone chose a poor time to put me out of commission, 87
puck, i am done contemplating imponderables, 88
puck, i return to the active world, 89
puck, another transformation, 90
puck, i pupate anew, 91
puck, turnabout is fair play, 92
puck, the scrolls of haize are concise on this matter with youth comes grave responsibility a thousand years of youth have fallen behind and still i fill the time with games, 93
puck, hatched on a frond of the undertree i devoured leaf stalk root and all of my sibs yet only halfway through this eon i already hunger for more, 94
puck, an item to be prized, 95

puck, crummy wizard, 184
puck, ah wisp your mordant wit is wasted on these gross beings, 185
puck, excellent an apparition of exceptional age what i wonder can it teach me, 186
puck, rumor speaks of the lone druid as an ancient one yet here i see barely a sprat, 187
puck, what the outworld represents and why one would destroy it is now a quandary that intrigues me, 188
puck, to be a true enigma it would be best to style oneself on something less studied than gravity, 189
puck, from what primordial eon does the rock of tiny hail, 190
puck, were you a bud of the undertree we could be no better companions, 191
puck, i find myself strangely drawn to this odd configuration of activity, 192
puck, blink dagger, 193
puck, i do enjoy an occasional blink, 194
puck, an item of no small merit, 195
puck, the worth of this gift is mine to plumb, 196
puck, my pleasure at this finding fractures the lenses of the real, 197
puck, a dark interval and now a bright one, 198
puck, whats this a fascinating substance, 199

puck, we two did sport but in the end she tired, 213
puck, what is this nature you speak of, 214
puck, wisp you are like a thought i once had but dismissed out of hand, 215
puck, i remember that one from some time long past, 216
puck, that one admired my wings but could not be trusted to care for her own, 217
puck, it would seem that almost anything can call itself a dragon in this age, 218
puck, if you are truly some sort of dragon you must be a juvenile form, 219
puck, i sense this book of yours may be full of erroneous information, 220
puck, a poor specimen not worthy of being mounted, 221
puck, i learned nothing from close observation of tinkers demise, 222
puck, again tinkers death yields no interesting conclusions, 223
puck, unnerving i understood every word, 224
puck, your comments cut me to the quick, 225
puck, i have been to claszureme they still speak of their relief at being rid of you, 226
puck, wisp i think you are too bold, 227
puck, wisp i disagree with your alliance yet you do make a compelling argument, 228
puck, ah scepter, 229
puck, i wield this scepter with authority, 230
puck, that was most welcome, 231
puck, my gratitude, 232

pudge, the story of me birth, 1868
pudge, is not pleasant to behold, 1869
pudge, such tales devoid of mirth, 1870
pudge, should never be retold, 1871
pudge, there was a child of both high blood and wealth, 1872
pudge, left abandoned to her own estate, 1873
pudge, with naught but servants to care about her health, 1874
pudge, it would not be fair to call her wickedness innate, 1875

pudge, a monster immune to all decay, 1878
pudge, gainst whom death aint got no grudge, 1879

pudge, and the designs would start at once, 1885
pudge, with no restraints or words of caution, 1886
pudge, the girls plans flew at quite a clip, 1887
pudge, guided by stories of the neverrotten, 1888
pudge, my final patterns were resolved with a scissors snip, 1889
pudge, so when the enchanter at last to krimwohl arrived, 1890
pudge, the required vessel was well ahead prepared, 1891
pudge, from a pudgesourced tidbit arcane makings were derived, 1892
pudge, for not a single one amongst the lot had the wisdom to be scared, 1893
pudge, i can tell you true of heart i want only a hug and smile to greet, 1894
pudge, but if you bring a pudge doll to life dont be surprised when you end up fresh meat, 1895

windrunner, worth it, 470
windrunner, ill take style points for that one, 471
windrunner, no let me, 472
windrunner, my arms not shaking, 473
windrunner, and me with blood in my eyes, 474
windrunner, tougher than it looked, 475
windrunner, caution to the wind and all that, 476
windrunner, double damage, 477
windrunner, one arrow twice the knockdown, 478
windrunner, the gale can always get stronger, 479
windrunner, one more for my quiver, 480
windrunner, ooh what a windfall, 481
windrunner, where the heck did that come from, 482
windrunner, my familymy real familywas special but they werent alone in their gifts, 483
windrunner, other distant clans had also learned to forge ethereal connections with forces mortals could scarce comprehend, 484
windrunner, and not just with our precious wind other elements had their adherents as well, 485
windrunner, it was from an elder who sits amongst the servants of the dancing flame that i heard the truth of my people, 486
windrunner, one who knew friendship with my ancestors one who mourned their passing and celebrated my return, 487
windrunner, youre not getting rid of me that easy, 488
windrunner, how about we dont, 489
windrunner, the wind rises, 490
windrunner, you cannot stop the rising gale, 491
windrunner, first blood thats an ill wind for someone not me though, 492
windrunner, first blood of course it was me, 493
windrunner, first blood mostly skill but sure maybe a little bit of luck, 494
windrunner, first blood and already a scent of death on the breeze, 495
windrunner, first blood ok lets not get carried away, 496
windrunner, its about precision not overkill, 497
windrunner, coulda been better, 498
windrunner, just a few plinks, 499
windrunner, maybe i was shooting the same holes id already made, 500
windrunner, oh thats just gross, 501
windrunner, never seen a broadhead before, 502
windrunner, bet you didnt know arrows could do so much damage, 503
windrunner, short work as usual, 504
windrunner, im surprised they even lasted that long, 505
windrunner, wait is that it, 506
windrunner, i guess im done, 507
windrunner, talk about grouping, 508
windrunner, its ok what else have i got to do, 509
windrunner, that was more mentally taxing than physically, 510
windrunner, whew that took forever, 511
windrunner, well shoot, 512
windrunner, well that was a waste, 513
windrunner, ya know sometimes i could just, 514
windrunner, that was a warmup gotta keep loose, 515
windrunner, really wanted that to go better, 516
windrunner, whats up with my bow, 517
windrunner, hey did someone mess with my bow, 518
windrunner, ok that ones on me, 519
windrunner, gotta love the efficiency, 520
windrunner, might notta needed that here but it was fun, 521
windrunner, they dont all fall that fast, 522
windrunner, well that was easy, 523
windrunner, good thing i dont get tired, 524
windrunner, i was going for a record, 525
windrunner, good thing ive got a line on cheap arrows, 526
windrunner, theyre the quiver now, 527
windrunner, my paternal greatgrandfather was high priest in zarukina, 528
windrunner, he despised the windwalkers of the gale resented their influence, 529
windrunner, so when his son fell in love with a member of the gales oldest family he saw an opportunity, 530
windrunner, he did not rush he sanctioned their union welcomed my grandmother into the village with open arms, 531
windrunner, he spent time with members of the order learned as much as he could about our ways, 532
windrunner, then slowly but surely he began to sow the seeds of fear and doubt about the true motives of those embraced by the gale, 533
windrunner, in the minds of my grandmother and a growing number of villagers, 534
windrunner, so slowly that the changes were almost imperceptible until it was entirely too late, 535
windrunner, my grandmother was different than her sisters she was ungifted in the ways of the gale, 536
windrunner, in those days even though they lived apart the order of the rising gale played an important role in zarukinan affairs, 537
windrunner, together with the worshippers of the angvol theirs was the counsel the village elders would seek in guiding the people, 538
windrunner, unlike those who prayed to the angvol the rising gale was not an open congregation, 539
windrunner, you were either born into the order or you werent, 540
windrunner, but it was very rare for one of my family line to be born without the blessings of mother wind, 541
windrunner, so it was only natural that my grandmother would make a normal life for herself in zarukina, 542
windrunner, that she would find comfort and love there amongst the normal people, 543
windrunner, but just as love can be a source of immense good it can also be a conduit for great evil, 544
windrunner, haaaah, 545
windrunner, haaaah, 546
windrunner, haaaah, 547

windrunner, oh yeah this is totally in the bag, 565
windrunner, set the bag aloft the wind will carry it, 566
windrunner, not gonna lie i kinda wanna shoot the bag, 567
windrunner, maybe we could turn the bag into some kind of sail then wed have this thing for sure, 568
windrunner, the only way we can lose this is if i join the other side which aint gonna happen, 569
windrunner, the elder winds rise again, 570

windrunner, well that was easy i didnt even have to aim at you, 939
windrunner, you think your presence here went unnoticed tell your people there are watchers still, 940
windrunner, there arent enough arrows to account for all your sins, 941
windrunner, that contraption of yours is a classic case of overengineered and underdesigned, 942
windrunner, you thought this path was a choice but all you did was react to the choices of others, 943
windrunner, now that was a target where can i get another one, 944
windrunner, i feel a great sadness though i know not why, 945
windrunner, i could have shot at those orbs all day but battle before pleasure, 946

windrunner, i wont celebrate the end of such a pitiable existence but i wont mourn it either, 954
windrunner, oh sorry i swear i heard someone say fire, 955
windrunner, everyone thinks theyre important until theyve got an arrow in their eye, 956
windrunner, i dont wish an end to your line druid but sometimes a price must be paid, 957

windrunner, rigid belief structures meet horrific ends, 975
windrunner, you praise the omniscience for your victories does it share blame in your defeat, 976
windrunner, as if the likes of you could predict the course of the wind, 977
windrunner, you abandoned your true mission just to die like this, 978
windrunner, gallantry and folly are common bedfellows, 979
windrunner, i know im on no lists assassin whats your business here, 980
windrunner, what kind of sisters would send you to this fate, 981
windrunner, my arrows will always point out the truth, 982
windrunner, shooting arrows at the sun is like something an imbecile would do funny how it worked out, 983
windrunner, we were meant to be allies puck i felt it to be so, 984
windrunner, on second thought maybe i wont try to recover any of those arrows, 985
windrunner, your nether magic has no place on this plane, 986
windrunner, its alwalys easy to defeat a demon theyve got such onetrack minds, 987
windrunner, by what right do you break the contract that kept you in the maze, 988
windrunner, you were easy enough to see inside the outline of my arrows, 989
windrunner, a staff is just a stick a bow is a stick with some string on it obviously an upgrade, 990
windrunner, the sand only goes where the wind directs it, 991
windrunner, is there some kind of portal to hell around here somewhere that i should know about, 992
windrunner, if even you amongst the demonkind cannot abide by the pact who will, 993
windrunner, lonely creature i put an end to your suffering, 994
windrunner, so goes the path of the selfrighteous, 995
windrunner, you denied yourself a chance at a meaningful life skywrath at least i gave you an honorable death, 996
windrunner, theres a simple explanation for this slardar you were just out of your element, 997
windrunner, its not for your crimes that you meet your death but for your wicked heart, 998

windrunner, you gotta flow with it the angry path is always gonna lead here, 1016
windrunner, its a sad day when the just cross swords or bows or fists or whatever, 1017
windrunner, tyrants always want to conquer that which they can barely fathom let alone create, 1018
windrunner, ok that went alright thought i was gonna need more backup, 1019

windrunner, its time for you to rest vengeful one let the living carry on the fight, 1021
windrunner, ever seen a slug pinned to a tree with nothing but arrows, 1022
windrunner, you should have retreated when i winged you viper, 1023
windrunner, this is not your place visage the laws of nature must be followed, 1024

windrunner, you could have used your knowledge for good warlock at every fork you chose evil, 1026
windrunner, im not squeamish but i wouldnt mind never seeing another one of those ever again, 1027
windrunner, only a monster would take pleasure in slaying such a mystifying creature, 1028
windrunner, ugh youre a weird little dead thing, 1029
windrunner, we did the impossible once but our truce was always uneasy, 1030
windrunner, arrows are traditionally ineffective against your kind but really if you shoot anything enough, 1031
windrunner, the esteem of the gods has fallen a lot lately, 1032
windrunner, at least you died with honor thats more than most can say, 1033
windrunner, the string of my bow draws only at my command, 1034
windrunner, ya know a quip feels kind of wasted on him but i guess we quip for ourselves more than anything, 1035

windrunner, the day may come when i set down my bow but ill never set down my books, 1084
windrunner, how else would i sharpen my points, 1085
windrunner, some radical ideas in here, 1086
windrunner, everyone just assumes im this super awesome ranger type always ready to save the day and thats not wrong but theres a lot more to me than that, 1087
windrunner, sometimes the ones who read it wont need it and the ones who need it wont get it, 1088

queenofpain, whats not to love about the mortal realm, 249
queenofpain, plenty to see plenty to kill, 250
queenofpain, and hells some of the best screamers, 251
queenofpain, but sometimes a girls gotta go home, 252
queenofpain, and a lot can change time passes differently down there, 253
queenofpain, influence abandoned is influence lost, 254
queenofpain, and in my brothers case finders keepers, 255
queenofpain, my brother bkor a more wretched demon you will not meet, 256
queenofpain, he barely crosses the bar, 257
queenofpain, but in the court of ristul he has won much favor of late, 258
queenofpain, while i enjoyed my time away he made new friends and eliminated a host of foes, 259
queenofpain, he has powerful allies now and it seems they have grand plans, 260
queenofpain, but none of those plans i gathered include me, 261
queenofpain, so i guess its time to misbehave, 262
queenofpain, its amazing what one can find in weeping rose, 263
queenofpain, if you look past the useless arcanists and seers there are some real treasures, 264
queenofpain, look hard enough one might even find knogh, 265
queenofpain, he who like i once was is bound to another, 266
queenofpain, but knoghs star falls even further than mine, 267
queenofpain, all but forgotten by the demon lords by those like my brother, 268
queenofpain, my enemies are now knoghs as well his former allies and they have taken much from him, 269
queenofpain, but i am no longer bound to serve i can still hold sway in the court of ristul, 270
queenofpain, i can take back what has been lost, 271
queenofpain, so as demons do we struck a bargain and the measure of knoghs power flows through me now, 272
queenofpain, let nevermore gloat about the soul of his pet vhoul and vrogros plan his assaults, 273
queenofpain, let bkor laugh and play master of ceremony for the other demons to his black hearts content, 274
queenofpain, in time i will come for all of them in time i will be queen of all that is above and below, 275
queenofpain, where theres a whip theres a way, 276
queenofpain, queendom come, 277

faceless_void, ah ha ha ah ha ha oh ho haa ha ha ha ha haaa, 723
faceless_void, my foresight sharpens, 724
faceless_void, time quickens, 725
faceless_void, my control improves, 726
faceless_void, my powers grow, 727
faceless_void, a timely increase in power, 728
faceless_void, hmm hmm hmmm hmm hmm hmm hmm, 729
faceless_void, hmm hmm hmm hmm of course, 730
faceless_void, hm hm hmm ha ha haaa yeesss, 731
faceless_void, even clasz himself need fear me, 732
faceless_void, to be an aspect of clasz is not enough, 733
faceless_void, i bide my time and recruit wisely, 734
faceless_void, they think me a gateway but i refuse, 735
faceless_void, my fate will not be written here, 736
faceless_void, this realm has much to offer, 737
faceless_void, i take power where i please, 738
faceless_void, yes i feel it, 739
faceless_void, every day lived is a page of history, 740
faceless_void, time is a river with many eddies i have seen its head waters and i have seen its currents reach the sea, 741
faceless_void, i may be faceless but im not maceless, 742
faceless_void, no, 743
faceless_void, no, 744
faceless_void, defeated, 745
faceless_void, some things were just not meant to be, 746
faceless_void, the power of clasz consumes me, 747
faceless_void, the final gateway opens, 748
faceless_void, and now this dimension will fall, 749
faceless_void, ah mask of madness, 750
faceless_void, ah mask of madness a perfect fit, 751
faceless_void, for one of my kind initiation as an acolyte of clasz is the highest honor, 752
faceless_void, and i wore that mantle well, 753
faceless_void, fully devoted to my future as an aspect of clasz the infinite, 754
faceless_void, too naive to understand what such devotion truly means, 755
faceless_void, but i learned that i would lose myself entirely to his expanse, 756
faceless_void, and slowly my pride turned to spite and anger, 757
faceless_void, my focus changed from supplication to subversion, 758
faceless_void, from my position of influence i began to recruit fresh acolytes to a secret cause, 759
faceless_void, some witting others much less so, 760
faceless_void, but all working towards my will, 761
faceless_void, to control my transformation ritual, 762
faceless_void, to keep my head above the surface of oblivion, 763
faceless_void, and bend claszs own powers against the infinite one himself, 764
faceless_void, we who thrive in claszureme exist outside of time, 765
faceless_void, we do not age, 766
faceless_void, our advancements are measured through study, 767
faceless_void, and the transformation of knowledge into power, 768
faceless_void, when we look upon your realm we cannot see our own futures as we can yours, 769
faceless_void, but in study of the ripples and swirls of your flowing rivers, 770
faceless_void, we might divine something of our own fates amongst the impossible voids that manifest between the streams, 771
faceless_void, those in this pathetic realm should thank me, 772
faceless_void, my attempts at survival have kept barred a dire gate, 773
faceless_void, were i to complete my transformation, 774
faceless_void, the full power of clasz would flow through this form, 775
faceless_void, and your plane and all you wriggling denizens would forever cease to be, 776
faceless_void, for now clasz hunts and i evade his expanse, 777
faceless_void, i know to turn his tendrils against my own enemies, 778
faceless_void, and those he devours in my stead briefly sate his need, 779
faceless_void, but should i fail to provide worthy fodder, 780
faceless_void, one shudders to imagine what my fate could be, 781
faceless_void, we were not created by clasz, 782
faceless_void, such efforts are alien to him, 783
faceless_void, we are mere lichen or fungus, 784
faceless_void, the claszian expanse provided the conditions and we materialized to feast, 785
faceless_void, but now i take the next step, 786
faceless_void, i demand more than just a piece from clasz, 787
faceless_void, i carve a swath and i claim it for myself, 788
faceless_void, yes, 789
faceless_void, yes, 790
faceless_void, it shall be, 791
faceless_void, i go, 792
faceless_void, the march of time, 793
faceless_void, inexorable, 794
faceless_void, dark portents ahead, 795
faceless_void, my path unspools, 796
faceless_void, road to oblivion, 797
faceless_void, time flows, 798
faceless_void, a path foreseen, 799
faceless_void, face forward, 800
faceless_void, foreseen is forearmed, 801
faceless_void, presently, 802
faceless_void, as chosen, 803
faceless_void, a necessary decree, 804
faceless_void, in due time, 805
faceless_void, still my own path, 806
faceless_void, of true mind, 807
faceless_void, my will demands it, 808
faceless_void, the river curls, 809
faceless_void, the true course, 810
faceless_void, unhindered, 811
faceless_void, all time to waste, 812
faceless_void, of course, 813
faceless_void, yes, 814
faceless_void, i know, 815
faceless_void, fine, 816
faceless_void, tedious, 817
faceless_void, im sure, 818
faceless_void, i know it, 819
faceless_void, well see, 820
faceless_void, nooooooo, 821
faceless_void, out of mana, 822
faceless_void, no mana, 823
faceless_void, not enough mana, 824
faceless_void, out of mana, 825
faceless_void, no mana, 826
faceless_void, not enough mana, 827
faceless_void, out of mana, 828
faceless_void, no mana, 829
faceless_void, not enough mana, 830
faceless_void, not yet, 831
faceless_void, im not ready, 832
faceless_void, its not time yet, 833
faceless_void, not yet, 834
faceless_void, im not ready, 835
faceless_void, its not time yet, 836
faceless_void, not yet, 837
faceless_void, im not ready, 838
faceless_void, its not time yet, 839
faceless_void, i light a beacon in the void, 840
faceless_void, a small piece in the outcome of this war, 841
faceless_void, ah, 842
faceless_void, uhh, 843
faceless_void, ah, 844
faceless_void, aahh, 845
faceless_void, uaah, 846
faceless_void, aaahh, 847
faceless_void, heh face value indeed, 848
faceless_void, im meant to own this, 849
faceless_void, well bought, 850
faceless_void, regeneration, 851
faceless_void, turned back the clock, 852
faceless_void, it was meant for me, 853
faceless_void, like the sun i rise again, 854
faceless_void, time tells the mace fells, 855
faceless_void, i have seen the end of time, 856
faceless_void, a new age begins, 857
faceless_void, so begins the final epoch, 858
faceless_void, the end is already written, 859
faceless_void, returned from clazureme, 860
faceless_void, i returned to fulfill my destiny, 861
faceless_void, time is a river with many eddies, 862
faceless_void, my pendulum swings back to life, 863
faceless_void, i evade clasz death holds no power over me, 864
faceless_void, sever one tendril and another will always replace it, 865
faceless_void, i am a gateway that must remain closed, 866
faceless_void, well always have enough time, 867
faceless_void, ive grown to like it here, 868
faceless_void, i grow now like a weed you cannot kill me, 869
faceless_void, even the coldest mists dissipate in time, 870
faceless_void, i have little use for the pair of you, 871
faceless_void, much easier to dispatch you here, 872
faceless_void, an ant amongst mages, 873
faceless_void, the ancient pales in the shadow of the infinite, 874
faceless_void, a life without meaning meets merciful end, 875
faceless_void, dreams are fleeting death is not, 876
faceless_void, fight or flight you chose poorly, 877
faceless_void, the beasts will writhe before a new master, 878
faceless_void, bloodlust leads to bitter ruin, 879
faceless_void, i need not hide my tracks from the likes of you, 880
faceless_void, drunk on life high on death, 881
faceless_void, be honored i waste words on you, 882
faceless_void, my tendrils are the only web this world needs, 883
faceless_void, you should have known your place was in the dirt, 884
faceless_void, even you are blind to your true intent, 885
faceless_void, out of my way worm, 886
faceless_void, here burns the endless pyre of clinkz, 887
faceless_void, what dents the armor liquifies the corpse, 888
faceless_void, sturdy armor brittle bones, 889
faceless_void, even the winter warden withers in true cold, 890
faceless_void, you cannot steal that which i allowed you to have, 891
faceless_void, you played your part unwittingly well, 892
faceless_void, you still ponder the universe with a childs mind, 893
faceless_void, nothl is known to clasz as inconsequential, 894
faceless_void, perhaps it will keep this time, 895
faceless_void, your mortal squabbles could never prepare you for me, 896
faceless_void, your petulant needs count for nothing now, 897
faceless_void, it will take a more impressive pairing than that to challenge me, 898
faceless_void, mortals perish so quickly, 899
faceless_void, earth is little more than dust, 900
faceless_void, i am not a pebble that trembles in your wake, 901
faceless_void, why join these children in death, 902
faceless_void, nothing burns forever, 903
faceless_void, nothing in your realm matters least of all some bags of meat, 904
faceless_void, you were but a shadow of your true self, 905
faceless_void, your transformation was an accident mine was well earned, 906
faceless_void, so falls the withered branch, 907
faceless_void, mash your controls harder, 908
faceless_void, your little bones broke all too well, 909
faceless_void, surprisingly vicious, 910
faceless_void, it takes cunning to face me you never had a chance, 911
faceless_void, if only i could harness your power and face the might of clasz, 912
faceless_void, your plans were transparent to me, 913
faceless_void, twice the fool in life and in death, 914
faceless_void, none will kill clasz but me, 915
faceless_void, did you take me for a kraken, 916
faceless_void, did you think me a demon tresdin im something far worse, 917
faceless_void, i never liked you, 918
faceless_void, you think your days long but here lies your end, 919
faceless_void, all hope extinguished, 920
faceless_void, your pathetic augmentation just wasnt enough, 921
faceless_void, your line ends, 922
faceless_void, next time bring selemene to the fight ill kill her too, 923
faceless_void, you should never have crossed me, 924
faceless_void, it was fun for a moment but i grew weary, 925
faceless_void, impressive for a human, 926
faceless_void, you dont even know why you fight, 927
faceless_void, how does this aid your sisters, 928
faceless_void, cut off one head and all the others die, 929
faceless_void, mercy is a game for children, 930
faceless_void, rest now ill defy the gods in your place, 931
faceless_void, you always were a fool wu kong but one with a glorious fate, 932
faceless_void, it seems you strayed away from a wiser path, 933
faceless_void, your kingdoms will meet the same fate, 934
faceless_void, now much darker roots are set to grow, 935
faceless_void, if nothing else ive done the world a favor, 936
faceless_void, age is meaningless here, 937
faceless_void, fascinating creature, 938
faceless_void, faceless void meets mental void, 939
faceless_void, can your bedtime story save you now, 940
faceless_void, youve seen much from a limited perspective, 941
faceless_void, everything youve accomplished was already meant to be, 942
faceless_void, little more than a haggard dog, 943
faceless_void, once void of purpose now void of breath, 944
faceless_void, i was once like you a pawn, 945
faceless_void, i have no time for phantoms there are ancients to kill, 946
faceless_void, those arent stars that shine in the void, 947
faceless_void, useless beast, 948
faceless_void, best to deal with you before you know what you are, 949
faceless_void, one less future to worry about, 950
faceless_void, but never to be rid of your carcass, 951
faceless_void, i dont have time for this, 952
faceless_void, i give you pain without end, 953
faceless_void, your foolish masters will miss you, 954
faceless_void, better to die here in freedom than thrive as the master of that maze, 955
faceless_void, i dont need to see you fool, 956
faceless_void, go cry to daddy, 957
faceless_void, i make art of you, 958
faceless_void, fear not ill slay your followers too, 959
faceless_void, you were far too busy with trivial pursuits, 960
faceless_void, i dont know you and i dont care, 961
faceless_void, such hubris this death was too good for you, 962
faceless_void, your aims were small i wont waste another thought on you, 963
faceless_void, you came of age on a playground, 964
faceless_void, never bring a knife to a god fight, 965
faceless_void, a laughable obsession with fire, 966
faceless_void, that clever toy cant save you, 967
faceless_void, your path stretched far enough, 968
faceless_void, your master needs another pet, 969
faceless_void, so ends your flight of fancy, 970
faceless_void, here lies a broken sword, 971
faceless_void, mortal fungus, 972
faceless_void, wheres your precious master now, 973
faceless_void, nothing to fear from you, 974
faceless_void, ill overcome maelrawn next, 975
faceless_void, there arent enough blades in this world, 976
faceless_void, do not pry into the affairs of claszureme, 977
faceless_void, a minor impediment, 978
faceless_void, our roots will replace you, 979
faceless_void, i dare say he enjoyed eating my mace, 980
faceless_void, your pathetic story ends here, 981
faceless_void, i think you missed your stop, 982
faceless_void, i think nothing of the dirge, 983
faceless_void, barely worth the effort, 984
faceless_void, sell your sob story somewhere else, 985
faceless_void, it feels good to squish a worm, 986
faceless_void, it seems i had the thicker skin, 987
faceless_void, and now a visageless void as well, 988
faceless_void, to think i once feared you, 989
faceless_void, you have no power in that form, 990
faceless_void, no one will care to read about this, 991
faceless_void, you could have been useful but my plans have never relied upon you, 992
faceless_void, so falls the wind that rises, 993
faceless_void, at last weve cured your disease, 994
faceless_void, just mush beneath my feet, 995
faceless_void, the wrong side of a familiar coin, 996
faceless_void, join yourself in death, 997
faceless_void, ahhh scepter, 998
faceless_void, scepter, 999
faceless_void, shitty wizard, 1000
faceless_void, faceless void, 1001
faceless_void, i have seen how this war ends, 1002
faceless_void, i am the elder one, 1003
faceless_void, from a place beyond time and time beyond counting, 1004
faceless_void, always elder now a god, 1005
faceless_void, what clasz surrendered i refuse to let go, 1006
faceless_void, i steal strength from the claszian expanse, 1007
faceless_void, should i fall so too shall all of you, 1008
faceless_void, i alone hold back the flood of clasz, 1009
faceless_void, time enough to learn what i need, 1010
faceless_void, faceless oblivion, 1011
faceless_void, i move freely amongst those shackled by fate, 1012
faceless_void, the beggars path, 1013
faceless_void, slow but still fast enough, 1014
faceless_void, a cheap means of travel, 1015
faceless_void, a low moment on my higher path, 1016
faceless_void, better than calling in a favor, 1017
faceless_void, i thank you, 1018
faceless_void, my gratitude, 1019
faceless_void, im under attack, 1020
faceless_void, focus on the present, 1021
faceless_void, alien water, 1022
faceless_void, youre going to have a bad time, 1023
faceless_void, a moment for me eternity for you, 1024
faceless_void, look into my eye, 1025
faceless_void, your mind is a flat circle, 1026
faceless_void, i saw your death coming and i still enjoyed it, 1027
faceless_void, all of your sand is in the bottom of the glass, 1028
faceless_void, no surprise to me, 1029
faceless_void, you were always destined to die, 1030
faceless_void, if only i could see the look on your face, 1031
faceless_void, a waste of time and space, 1032
faceless_void, put on a happy face, 1033
faceless_void, faceless annoyed, 1034
faceless_void, does this look like a face that cares, 1035
faceless_void, if only you could turn back time, 1036
faceless_void, your fate was failure, 1037
faceless_void, ahhh ha ha ha ha ha haaa, 1038
faceless_void, gratitude would imply you had free will, 1039
faceless_void, i have no use for decorum, 1040
faceless_void, grace means nothing in the void, 1041
faceless_void, yes, 1042
faceless_void, victory, 1043
faceless_void, just as i envisaged, 1044
faceless_void, the power to destroy clasz will set me free, 1045
faceless_void, now to destroy clasz and claim his expanse, 1046
faceless_void, the acolyte ascends, 1047

skeleton_king, even titans must bent the knee, 131
skeleton_king, court mage more like court jester, 132
skeleton_king, your spirit was too lowly to stand before a king, 133

skeleton_king, wah ha ha ha ha, 410
skeleton_king, when i look out my window i see a kingdom of bone, 411
skeleton_king, when i dont see a kingdom of bone i see a land begging to be a part of it, 412
skeleton_king, one kingdom after another falls as i build my great empire, 413
skeleton_king, and when there are no more worlds to conquer will i weep, 414
skeleton_king, do i look like the sentimental type, 415
skeleton_king, by that point the first additions will need a good reminder anyway, 416
skeleton_king, if you chop off my arm im just going to stick it back on there, 417
skeleton_king, if you sever my head eventually my body will find its way home, 418
skeleton_king, hold no hope to defeat me i am immortal royalty and you are lower than a peasant, 419
skeleton_king, i have no need for memories of flesh, 420
skeleton_king, flesh decays flesh ends, 421
skeleton_king, but i will not end my reign will not end, 422
skeleton_king, those who understand that fact can find a place in my empire, 423
skeleton_king, those who oppose it well ill find a place for them in my empire too as crafted bone, 424
skeleton_king, skeleton king, 425
skeleton_king, bow to your king, 426
skeleton_king, king am i of all that is flesh and bone, 427
skeleton_king, do not question my purpose just follow my commands, 428
skeleton_king, the bone king, 429
skeleton_king, and so the war begins, 430
skeleton_king, they could all surrender now but something tells me they arent smart enough, 431
skeleton_king, worry not peasants this war can finally begin, 432
skeleton_king, lets get this over with quickly ive got nations to kill, 433
skeleton_king, run from it if you will but none can stop the legion of bone, 434
skeleton_king, at this point you really should just address me as emperor, 435
skeleton_king, in a pathetic way i sometimes envy those who get to wake each day in my kingdom free of the worries concerning its expansion, 436
skeleton_king, theres something different today but i cant put my finger on it, 437
skeleton_king, where i tread a kingdom of bone follows, 438
skeleton_king, count yourselves fortunate mortals and other base creatures you finally have a chance to be part of something that will last forever, 439
skeleton_king, theres nothing unhealthy about my obsession here let me show you, 440
skeleton_king, i have a very good feeling about today call it kingly intuition, 441
skeleton_king, dont call it a comeback, 442
skeleton_king, kneel before your king and i might spare your head, 443
skeleton_king, kneel peasants i said kneel, 444
skeleton_king, a fresh harvest begins, 445
skeleton_king, submit to the empire of bone, 446
skeleton_king, people keep asking if im back yeah im thinkin im back, 447
skeleton_king, who dares approach my throne, 448
skeleton_king, swear you fealty to the empire of bone, 449
skeleton_king, wherever i lay my throne is home, 450
skeleton_king, i swing the executioners blade myself, 451
skeleton_king, bow before me or prepare to meet your fate, 452
skeleton_king, i do not suffer fools in my court i prefer to make them suffer, 453
skeleton_king, have you come to surrender very well then sigh prepare to die, 454
skeleton_king, surprised to see me yeah i get that a lot, 455
skeleton_king, look at all these plots ive got work to do, 456
skeleton_king, never put off until tomorrow killing those you can find today, 457
skeleton_king, trust me these gravesll be filled in no time, 458
skeleton_king, i just thought of the perfect place to kill a few rivals in no time no questions asked, 459
skeleton_king, i better not hear of any doubts or youll be the first body buried here, 460
skeleton_king, look upon my collection and rejoice, 461
skeleton_king, the graves of nations build a glorious empire, 462
skeleton_king, ive laid waste to nations but these here these are the special ones, 463
skeleton_king, after lifetimes of gratuitous slaughter its nice to bring new meaning to things, 464
skeleton_king, nothing brightens up the aeons like a good game of collect the corpse, 465
skeleton_king, who are we going to kill today, 466
skeleton_king, slaughter is just one letter away from slaughters so lets not limit our imaginations to one at a time, 467
skeleton_king, its the little things that make a life hearth an empire of bone and collecting the corpses of noteworthy opponents, 468
skeleton_king, the smart ones consider it an honor to be added to my collection but most still put up a fight, 469
skeleton_king, different bones for different reasons do i need these bones specifically well say yes, 470
skeleton_king, theres a fine line between a collection and a compulsion, 471
skeleton_king, my schemes are all about plots plots as far as the eye can see, 472
skeleton_king, it was kind of you to grow that skeleton to maturity for me, 473
skeleton_king, the empire of bone knows no bounds nor should it, 474
skeleton_king, long life has made me something of a completionist, 475
skeleton_king, what the king wants the king gets, 476
skeleton_king, its good to be the king, 477
skeleton_king, who else should have such a fine collection, 478
skeleton_king, an empire of bones is built atop rivers of blood, 479
skeleton_king, you cant build an empire without breaking a few bones, 480
skeleton_king, if it has bones ive killed it hell if it doesnt have bones ive probably killed it, 481
skeleton_king, the bone war begins, 482
skeleton_king, comes now the king of bones, 483
skeleton_king, you havent known war until youve warred with me, 484
skeleton_king, i wont go easy on you the weak and stupid die where they stand, 485
skeleton_king, ill help my weak and puny allies where i can, 486
skeleton_king, first blood ive still got it, 487
skeleton_king, it is only right that first blood should go to your king, 488
skeleton_king, first blood now to the business of the day, 489
skeleton_king, first blood the bone harvest begins, 490
skeleton_king, if you were going to live this would make a great story for you, 491
skeleton_king, i envy your tears though i would never have need to shed them, 492
skeleton_king, believe it or not there is a painless way to remove your all your bones it just involves killing you first and what fun would that be, 493
skeleton_king, you can remove yourself now i mistook those abnormal growths for interesting bone structure, 494
skeleton_king, we are in agreement, 495
skeleton_king, by my decree, 496
skeleton_king, wise counsel, 497
skeleton_king, as you advise, 498

phantom_assassin, ive read about your kind the form i imagined was a bit off but perhaps so are you, 503
phantom_assassin, i wore a mask when i was young but now im proud to show my face, 504
phantom_assassin, each one of you i meet just lowers the bar, 505
phantom_assassin, ive heard tales of your exploits now that i see you theyre easier to believe, 506
phantom_assassin, you have a sound mind for strategy but truly brilliant warriors are much more graceful than thee, 507
phantom_assassin, theres an unsettling air in your wake, 508
phantom_assassin, i wouldnt mind some icy armor in this fight, 509
phantom_assassin, we need not look far for a humbling lesson on greed, 510
phantom_assassin, your sister is really something lina neither of you sees it but she won your childish battle in the end, 511

phantom_assassin, must be tiresome always having someone around, 520
phantom_assassin, your royal bearing betrays you highness, 521
phantom_assassin, i never had a rebellious period wu kong but maybe being hunted from birth is close to the same, 522
phantom_assassin, i must ask morphling what compels you to join this fight, 523
phantom_assassin, i appreciate all genres of music even those from under the sea, 524
phantom_assassin, youre everywhere like a weed, 525

phantom_assassin, my ends are assured, 1052
phantom_assassin, the benefits of careful planning, 1053
phantom_assassin, fallen angels bless me, 1054

phantom_assassin, it gives purpose to hone ones gifts, 1056
phantom_assassin, a stunning power, 1057

phantom_assassin, ill enjoy watching them die, 1059
phantom_assassin, call to my enemies tell them where to find me, 1060
phantom_assassin, i know precisely what to do with these dark gifts, 1061
phantom_assassin, who dares to test me, 1062
phantom_assassin, time to show them the true meaning of fear, 1063
phantom_assassin, i didnt come here to play nicely, 1064
phantom_assassin, oh ive earned this, 1065
phantom_assassin, more power is my right, 1066
phantom_assassin, ah yes, 1067
phantom_assassin, nearing perfection, 1068
phantom_assassin, what else do i need for my kit, 1069
phantom_assassin, let us finally end this wretched fight, 1070
phantom_assassin, all my plans waylaid for this, 1071
phantom_assassin, ive gained nothing here, 1072
phantom_assassin, imbeciles, 1073
phantom_assassin, can we accomplish nothing, 1074
phantom_assassin, i wont take blame for what happened here, 1075
phantom_assassin, theres no meaning in this, 1076
phantom_assassin, my blades are useless, 1077
phantom_assassin, missing top, 1078
phantom_assassin, missind middle, 1079
phantom_assassin, missing bottom, 1080
phantom_assassin, i had no parents only teachers, 1081
phantom_assassin, disgraced sisters of the veiled order, 1082
phantom_assassin, who plucked me from the vipers nest, 1083
phantom_assassin, for i alone was born to stand against those who scheme to alter fate, 1084
phantom_assassin, i was not a child to them i was a focal point a tool in need of sharpening, 1085
phantom_assassin, a reservoir for the pain and rage of a dozen broken souls, 1086
phantom_assassin, and i did all i could to excel, 1087
phantom_assassin, but we were hunted, 1088
phantom_assassin, one by one my teachers were taken from me, 1089
phantom_assassin, i embrace that suffering, 1090
phantom_assassin, this path has molded me into the perfect weapon, 1091
phantom_assassin, and the dark dreams of my shepherds are finally at hand, 1092
phantom_assassin, i was raised by fallen angels the outcasts of the order, 1093
phantom_assassin, but it was not they alone who saved me, 1094
phantom_assassin, there was another, 1095
phantom_assassin, a ghostly figure inspiring equal parts love and fear, 1096
phantom_assassin, she guided the hands of my saviors, 1097
phantom_assassin, and still appears to me in times of dire need, 1098
phantom_assassin, i try not to imagine what the fruits of victory might be, 1099
phantom_assassin, i must focus on my mission on the arc of my blade, 1100
phantom_assassin, but there are times when curiosity sets in, 1101
phantom_assassin, what becomes of a bladeless assassin, 1102
phantom_assassin, can i ever truly escape this bloody work, 1103
phantom_assassin, there are tenets of the veiled order that i do hold dear, 1104
phantom_assassin, the ways of the sisterhood of old before the oracles poisoned tongue corrupted their ears, 1105
phantom_assassin, but it isnt for me to rebuild what has long been broken, 1106
phantom_assassin, no i hold to a single purpose, 1107
phantom_assassin, to raze the order of the veil to its very foundations, 1108
phantom_assassin, and leave only bloodstains in my wake, 1109
phantom_assassin, even as the veiled ones hunt me they whisper asan do not fear, 1110
phantom_assassin, but my first memories, 1111
phantom_assassin, their daggers flashing above my crib, 1112
phantom_assassin, still they call me brother, 1113
phantom_assassin, well my sisters, 1114
phantom_assassin, you may call yourselves saviors or phantoms or whatever you please, 1115
phantom_assassin, you might pretend youve mastered your fears, 1116
phantom_assassin, but your own beliefs betray you, 1117
phantom_assassin, dark prophecy rises and none of you will hide from my wrath, 1118
phantom_assassin, willingly, 1119
phantom_assassin, i see it too, 1120
phantom_assassin, there will do nicely, 1121
phantom_assassin, a good move, 1122
phantom_assassin, cunning, 1123
phantom_assassin, a decision rightly made, 1124
phantom_assassin, lightly, 1125
phantom_assassin, go quietly, 1126
phantom_assassin, i trust its the right path, 1127
phantom_assassin, taking this position, 1128
phantom_assassin, they wont expect this, 1129
phantom_assassin, on to the next kill, 1130
phantom_assassin, tread carefully here, 1131
phantom_assassin, my blade is always ready, 1132
phantom_assassin, i trust its where i need to be, 1133
phantom_assassin, no objections, 1134
phantom_assassin, leave it to me, 1135
phantom_assassin, a strange compulsion, 1136
phantom_assassin, who meets my blade, 1137
phantom_assassin, a certain step, 1138
phantom_assassin, yes, 1139
phantom_assassin, of course, 1140

phantom_assassin, ill fight to the death, 1224
phantom_assassin, perhaps im a phantom in more than occupation, 1225
phantom_assassin, easy enough to measure your weakness and send you to an early grave, 1226
phantom_assassin, youve been sniffing too many potions razzil to go against me was insane, 1227
phantom_assassin, just a failed manifestation of a distant fate, 1228
phantom_assassin, i do you a favor with this merciful end to your quest, 1229
phantom_assassin, only a fool cant tell you apart, 1230
phantom_assassin, silence you insignificant brute, 1231
phantom_assassin, you think a nightmare could unsettle me ive been dodging death since birth, 1232
phantom_assassin, to fall to your like would be unworthy, 1233
phantom_assassin, your pets were a distraction but they couldnt save you from me, 1234
phantom_assassin, this was my first sacrifice i think it went well, 1235
phantom_assassin, the tracker who hunts the assassin is a true fool indeed, 1236
phantom_assassin, i may not indulge in liquors but now they douse my blade, 1237
phantom_assassin, if i lost to you then id deserve to die, 1238
phantom_assassin, why am i on pest control ive got more important matters to attend, 1239
phantom_assassin, you fight for show for glory i fight to survive, 1240

phantom_assassin, interesting hes motionless but the fire keeps burning, 1243
phantom_assassin, an engineer you may be with no head for armor, 1244

phantom_assassin, war is not won with foolish games only with blood on blade, 1247
phantom_assassin, ill consider myself thankful you were only a fraction of your true self, 1248
phantom_assassin, my upbringing was unconventional i had to learn young how to time my blade, 1249
phantom_assassin, those arent revenants just echoes of meaningless pain, 1250
phantom_assassin, i thought you were smarter than this, 1251
phantom_assassin, your vile rites could never bind me, 1252
phantom_assassin, no kinship amongst orphans we live by the blade, 1253
phantom_assassin, oh they all try to keep their distance, 1254
phantom_assassin, your rage is unfocused mine is sharp as a blade, 1255
phantom_assassin, why would one such as you waste their life testing me, 1256
phantom_assassin, better in the grave than lurking at my flanks, 1257
phantom_assassin, if a titan cannot stop me theres no hope for any of the rest, 1258
phantom_assassin, i used to practice my daggers on candles it doesnt take much to extinguish weak flames, 1259
phantom_assassin, leave it im a vegetarian, 1260

phantom_assassin, if i ate meat id roast you on a spit, 1266
phantom_assassin, you were too tempting a target living so close to the edge, 1267
phantom_assassin, if it comes back ill kill it again, 1268
phantom_assassin, arrogance breeds the greatest mistakes, 1269
phantom_assassin, there may not be honor in this death but there is pleasure, 1270
phantom_assassin, no pleasure in killing you but an enemy must be put in their place, 1271
phantom_assassin, only ghosts left to mourn you, 1272
phantom_assassin, theyll think less of me for this but why i see no virtues in you, 1273
phantom_assassin, youve had your time this age belongs to me, 1274
phantom_assassin, youve grown far too predictable, 1275
phantom_assassin, i had to wipe the spite off his face, 1276
phantom_assassin, endless malice ends here, 1277
phantom_assassin, i release you from whatever life this is, 1278
phantom_assassin, theres no patience for childish tantrums here, 1279
phantom_assassin, i accounted for your selfmutilation it didnt trouble me at all, 1280

phantom_assassin, my condolences to your bookie, 1288
phantom_assassin, will any of your people even know you died here, 1289
phantom_assassin, how did the gods fail so long to kill you, 1290
phantom_assassin, time to cut you down and poison your roots, 1291
phantom_assassin, whats one more assassin on my list, 1292
phantom_assassin, i carve a cancer from the heart of the order, 1293
phantom_assassin, your folly created me now you pay the price, 1294
phantom_assassin, you upset the balance of the order my purging blade resets things to right, 1295
phantom_assassin, on second thought this is all the fun that i need, 1296
phantom_assassin, if only id killed you sooner what foul business might be undone, 1297
phantom_assassin, oh ill savor this, 1298
phantom_assassin, impressive for a beast, 1299
phantom_assassin, ive learned too much of pain to be cowed by you, 1300
phantom_assassin, you should have heeded my advice, 1301
phantom_assassin, your age gains no favors here, 1302
phantom_assassin, id heard so much about you im unimpressed, 1303
phantom_assassin, not the assassin i was hunting but i wont complain, 1304
phantom_assassin, a twisted mind set free, 1305
phantom_assassin, thats for making me think i was blind, 1306
phantom_assassin, a fine pile of kindling, 1307
phantom_assassin, from one loner to another go to hell, 1308
phantom_assassin, ill take cunning over strength any day, 1309
phantom_assassin, now if youll forgive me i have to retch, 1310
phantom_assassin, with this kill i earn the mothers grace, 1311
phantom_assassin, may your master also feel my blade, 1312
phantom_assassin, i might have let you live if youd considered my request, 1313
phantom_assassin, i dont have time for you, 1314
phantom_assassin, some mistakes cannot be undone, 1315
phantom_assassin, theres no gale strong enough to save you, 1316
phantom_assassin, utter your last words if you wish, 1317
phantom_assassin, theres only one cure for your disease, 1318
phantom_assassin, it would even be my pleasure to kill you again, 1319
phantom_assassin, nothing but a big name, 1320
phantom_assassin, why did you force my hand, 1321
phantom_assassin, i will not ask your forgiveness, 1322
phantom_assassin, a world of suffering upon me, 1323
phantom_assassin, may you rest now in peace, 1324
phantom_assassin, for once my blade brings me sorrow, 1325
phantom_assassin, now i live my nightmare and you no longer here to wake me, 1326
phantom_assassin, most perfect scepter, 1327
phantom_assassin, ive never seen its equal, 1328
phantom_assassin, you obviously dont know its true worth, 1329
phantom_assassin, shitty wizard, 1330
phantom_assassin, asan, 1331

phantom_assassin, the true phantom rises, 1333
phantom_assassin, my malice will set things right, 1334
phantom_assassin, who assassinates the assassins me, 1335
phantom_assassin, i play my hand in shadow but my destiny lies in the light, 1336
phantom_assassin, the sisters of the veil fear me as plague, 1337
phantom_assassin, we waste precious time on this tiresome fight, 1338
phantom_assassin, the only phantom you need fear is me, 1339
phantom_assassin, what use have these ancients for me, 1340
phantom_assassin, how do i find myself here this fight is of no concern to me, 1341
phantom_assassin, i am the unveiled one, 1342
phantom_assassin, i am the unveiled one, 1343
phantom_assassin, i need no oracle, 1344
phantom_assassin, i dont welcome violence but violence has hunted my every step, 1345
phantom_assassin, i am the exile the unveiled, 1346
phantom_assassin, ill only kill those who cross me, 1347
phantom_assassin, my list of enemies grows shorter and then perhaps ill study peace, 1348
phantom_assassin, with my talents this should be short work, 1349
phantom_assassin, i wont say theyre beneath me but we wont need long here, 1350

dragon_knight, im just gonna relish that for a sec, 929
dragon_knight, i failed, 930
dragon_knight, i let you all down, 931
dragon_knight, this wasnt supposed to happen, 932
dragon_knight, i should probably just tell mirana how i feel which is stupid because she already knows how i feel so i really shouldnt have to say anything this really shouldnt be this hard gods why am i thinking about mirana when i need to be focusing on the ancients the ancients one red one blue mirana looks great in blue godsdamn it focus, 933
dragon_knight, luna says shes changed but i dont buy it she massacred fymryns family she occupied coedwig and demanded forced conversion its not just wrong its despicable, 934
dragon_knight, i dont agree with invoker about a lot of things but if theres one thing were on the same page about its that selemene is a monster the world would be better off without her, 935
dragon_knight, gods i hope that mirana doesnt get sucked back into her little moon cult selemene is a narcissist luna is a war criminal and the dark moon order are abunch of reglious zealots if she goes back to them its like shes learned nothing, 936
dragon_knight, one of these days im gonna go to white spire with axe and get drunk like really drunk like lets get into a fight with a criminal mastermind and in killing them end up taking over their organization drunk, 937
dragon_knight, its been too long since ive gone back to dragon hold see ritterfrau see kaden see my friends my family i need to do them all proud, 938
dragon_knight, i should take fymryn to weeping rose if she really spent her whole life in coedwig it would blow her mind oh man i should take marci too i could introduce her to wei those two would hit it off like crazy, 939
dragon_knight, its hard rectifying who i am what i am now its getting more difficult to tell where slyrak ends and i begin which means im responsible for what happened at lethsham a city full of innocent people burned alive i dont know why slyrak attacked i may never know but for the rest of my life i have to live what he did and i have to make peace that people are right to hate me for it, 940
dragon_knight, maybe i shouldnt have given that kid in hauptstadt the dragons tooth growing up in dragon hold wasnt easy you call those men and women your brothers look up to them and then some of them just dont come home its almost cruel we give a home to those that lost families only to give them a new family that they get to lose all over again, 941
dragon_knight, axe has goodkind i have bram mirana has marcie only one thing left to do start a band, 942
dragon_knight, on the move, 943

dragon_knight, this might sound strange but you got any magic pants, 1010
dragon_knight, i really shouldnt have closed down that bar last night, 1011
dragon_knight, if mirana thinks im a handful she should go out drinking with donte that guy is a force of nature, 1012
dragon_knight, i wonder what fymryns up to, 1013

grimstroke, it takes more than that to kill me, 207
grimstroke, when my life is threatened others suffer, 208
grimstroke, a patron of the arts, 209
grimstroke, a trifling sum, 210
grimstroke, as is my due, 211
grimstroke, starting a collection, 212

hoodwink, hrah, 335
hoodwink, ahh, 336
hoodwink, uah, 337
hoodwink, every now and then some citystinking crew will venture out into the brush trying to find whatever dumb things the latest fancy, 338
hoodwink, even without my help theyd end up dead one way or another, 339
hoodwink, sure as no greenhorns last long in the deep wood, 340
hoodwink, so i reckon whats the harm in taunting them a bit before they go, 341
hoodwink, theres always the classic durana bait game, 342
hoodwink, but you can also get creative with the dangerous terrain and other fun features of the forest, 343
hoodwink, have you ever seen a carniverous plant could take down a man, 344
hoodwink, yeah none of those blokes had either, 345
hoodwink, crummy wizard, 346

hoodwink, bugger all for you, 391
hoodwink, look at that one, 392
hoodwink, you were just like a second too slow, 393
hoodwink, i make a very fine point, 394
hoodwink, dont bust a gut on me, 395
hoodwink, its better this way, 396
hoodwink, what do you know, 397
hoodwink, perfection, 398
hoodwink, yeah still nah, 399
hoodwink, yeah still nah, 400
hoodwink, i thought we talked about this, 401
hoodwink, you look a bit crook mate, 402
hoodwink, thought id miss that eh, 403
hoodwink, still a steady hand, 404
hoodwink, the crank does most of the work, 405
hoodwink, i never said he was my friend, 406
hoodwink, he looked unsteady, 407
hoodwink, he wont hold it against me, 408
hoodwink, suck it up, 409
hoodwink, double damage, 410
hoodwink, double damage, 411
hoodwink, thatll bolster a point, 412
hoodwink, double trouble, 413
hoodwink, i take what i get and use it right, 414
hoodwink, always was a bit lucky, 415
hoodwink, yeah ok thats pretty shiny, 416
hoodwink, see the forest always provides, 417
hoodwink, paws down the most dangerous beastie in the deep wood is the durana, 418
hoodwink, and the dangers not just the tentacles or the teeth or the paralytic secretions neither, 419
hoodwink, its the temptation the loss of control, 420
hoodwink, because durana pheromones arent for breeding theyre for feeding, 421
hoodwink, and they affect different folk in different ways, 422
hoodwink, you havent seen bonkers till youve seen a column of cavalry get swept up in the durana daze, 423
hoodwink, some going giggly others going mad, 424
hoodwink, not a single one looking out for hungry beasties slinking up behind, 425
hoodwink, i dont have to worry though, 426
hoodwink, that stuff only works on bigger prey, 427
hoodwink, so even when one does does feel inclined to snatch at me well tentacles and teeth only go so far, 428
hoodwink, first thing you need to know about the durana they arent natural, 429
hoodwink, sure they breed fastern swamp rabbits, 430
hoodwink, but the first ones were conjured up outta thin air by some wizard, 431
hoodwink, and wizards are morons so of course the beasties got outta control and ran amok, 432
hoodwink, so now everybodys gotta deal with this horrific invasive species that likes to eat grown men for a snack, 433
hoodwink, heh though theres some in the pacified lands who think im in an invasive species, 434
hoodwink, maybe theyre not wrong, 435
hoodwink, when i can figure out how to bait the durana into krimwohl anyway i guess were gonna find out, 436
hoodwink, all we needed was a dirt nap, 437
hoodwink, dont call it a comeback, 438
hoodwink, first blood, 439
hoodwink, first blood, 440
hoodwink, first blood, 441
hoodwink, first blood always the sweetest, 442
hoodwink, first blood well that sets a tone, 443
hoodwink, first blood gotta be quick when im around, 444
hoodwink, first blood and its still pulsing, 445
hoodwink, first blood and just a crazy amount of it really, 446
hoodwink, wow, 447
hoodwink, mmmm, 448
hoodwink, woah, 449
hoodwink, huhey, 450
hoodwink, hah, 451
hoodwink, mmmmmmm, 452
hoodwink, haste, 453
hoodwink, hightail it, 454
hoodwink, oh wow my heart is beating really fast, 455
hoodwink, the first time i saw one of the work camps i knew id be back, 456
hoodwink, there was so much to muck up i could keep busy for days, 457
hoodwink, i never really thought about helping anyone escape, 458
hoodwink, i thought they wanted to be there even now i know heaps of em do, 459
hoodwink, but there were some who saw the lure of freedom even if the price seemed too steep, 460
hoodwink, life in the darkwoods not easy but the cunning can step free from the sight of wouldbe rulers, 461
hoodwink, and for some folk like me thats enough, 462
hoodwink, my uncle used to say wed never a had to leave home if that little goblin lady never showed up selling her magic powder, 463
hoodwink, krimwohl was mostly harmless before they got the black powder, 464
hoodwink, and whether she meant for them to suss out how to make it for themselves or not point is theyd never in a jillion yearsve done it without getting their mitts on it in the first place, 465
hoodwink, once they got it though their appetites grew all their appetites, 466
hoodwink, and any of us living on the lands they wanted had no choice but to surrender run or die to make a stand, 467
hoodwink, so we came to the wood tomokan the dark wood where they say bad things await all warm bloods that enter, 468
hoodwink, wasnt always that way i guess but it has been the stretch of my life, 469
hoodwink, used to just be some normal woods but then the wizard trials came, 470
hoodwink, some big old wizard schools set em up big tests to show off and challenge their rising stars, 471
hoodwink, but nothings worse in the world than a wizard out to prove something, 472
hoodwink, and they go and gather them all up in one place, 473
hoodwink, something bad was bound to happen and it did, 474
hoodwink, so all the normal folk had to leave the tomokan, 475
hoodwink, all you got left living there nows the outlaw type and those who got no other choice, 476
hoodwink, no sane folk would settle in the darkwood now, 477
hoodwink, and of course while all their little traps and beasties and jimjams are everywhere theres not a wizard to be found, 478
hoodwink, who needs em, 479
hoodwink, have to admit this really is a beautiful place to do some murder, 480
hoodwink, you know youre right its important to take care of the mind as well as the body it cant just be run run run kill kill kill all the time, 481
hoodwink, theyll sing songs about this one, 482
hoodwink, nothing makes an epic like a bunch of wet blankets all standing around, 483
hoodwink, sorry was off with the faeries, 484
hoodwink, how it going mate, 485
hoodwink, why are we just standing here, 486
hoodwink, i generally only like standing around when turning a crank, 487
hoodwink, anybody seen any action, 488

hoodwink, you go this way and ill go that way, 490
hoodwink, finally some decent help around here, 491

hoodwink, immortality, 493
hoodwink, youll be lucky if i only live twice, 494

hoodwink, ok lets see if i can murder all of you before i lose the first one, 496
hoodwink, you want a bag i can get you a bag what kind of bag, 497

hoodwink, it looks like the same tail but is it really am i even me, 944
hoodwink, what did we learn from that that even eggheads get lucky, 945
hoodwink, note to self extract bloody vengeance preferably before lunch, 946
hoodwink, let off a minute ive got to liberate some souls from some bodies, 947
hoodwink, ive always got another stash, 948
hoodwink, just a bit of respite, 949
hoodwink, ugh hang on a sec gotta stretch, 950
hoodwink, rigs in one piece so thats covered, 951
hoodwink, if i kept a journal id leave that dying part out, 952
hoodwink, guess that just happens round these parts, 953
hoodwink, i dunno what that horse had against me but enoughs enough, 954
hoodwink, thats what happens when you get a bruiser to fight your battles for you you get soft, 955
hoodwink, hate to shatter your dreams you frigid idiot, 956
hoodwink, you eh to be honest i was hopin for the other one, 957
hoodwink, the other one mightve had better luck, 958
hoodwink, this ones heaps of fun get to kill him again and again, 959
hoodwink, glad i didnt get zapped, 960
hoodwink, if i had a gold piece for every oglodi i killed id have enough to start using acorns for impractical purposes, 961
hoodwink, ill never burn that sight outta my brain, 962
hoodwink, that bat had a giant parasite i probably did him a favor, 963
hoodwink, look you knew we werent gonna get along just on general bloody principle, 964
hoodwink, youre better off drinking maple syrup, 965
hoodwink, oh mate this one must really sting for you eh, 966
hoodwink, im getting tipsy just from the stench, 967
hoodwink, neath those pickers youre mince like all the rest, 968
hoodwink, choice i needed some silk, 969
hoodwink, i reckon this one was worthy of at least a little respect, 970
hoodwink, whats more chaotic than that, 971
hoodwink, if i say what i feel my tongue might turn black and fall off, 972
hoodwink, this one feels better than most, 973
hoodwink, youre lucky we never ran into each other when you were alive you never wouldve survived to be cursed, 974
hoodwink, yeah you were pretty chill shame really, 975
hoodwink, cheer up eh now you can stop whining about your great sacrifice, 976
hoodwink, yay for the mischief but whats with the greed thats just a waste of your time, 977
hoodwink, are they bloody serious with these people where does someone like that even come from, 978
hoodwink, never had much time for pity parties where do you get off, 979
hoodwink, oops killed em both steada just one, 980
hoodwink, as you can see im somewhat of a disruptor myself, 981
hoodwink, all that power just another case of a stunning lack of imagination, 982
hoodwink, wait a second that dragon couldve chosen anyone and he chose you what the hell is wrong with this world, 983
hoodwink, you obviously werent born for this im surprised nobody showed you sooner, 984
hoodwink, hey what a coincidence my first hard targets to practice with were little rolling rocks i guess it prepared me better than i thought, 985
hoodwink, it was like aiming at the broadside of an oak what could be easier, 986
hoodwink, see the trick is never set limits for yourself i never set out to kill a titan but i never thought i couldnt neither, 987
hoodwink, shooting out candles and torches is easy but destroying the essence of flame itself yeah ill take it, 988
hoodwink, you cant tell me what to do i tell me what to do, 989
hoodwink, how can someone with no face look so damn smug, 990
hoodwink, ha ha look i gave him a proper face lets just call those bloodstains tears, 991
hoodwink, im all out of pity for the likes of you, 992
hoodwink, should i tell you what ive got planned for your little contraption, 993
hoodwink, thats for singing the fur, 994
hoodwink, dying lights already a clich after all, 995
hoodwink, yeah magics pretty neat and all but nothing compares to a heavy bolt and a dead shot eye, 996
hoodwink, those two dragons crashed together so hard they merged into one dumber slower dragon, 997
hoodwink, hoods are way better than masks just saying, 998
hoodwink, hey oldtimer the sun sets on everybody whether they like it or not, 999
hoodwink, you can think of these trees as masts if it helps you die in peace, 1000

hoodwink, im not here to explain what went wrong its just obvious that something did i mean otherwise, 1008
hoodwink, i reckon a lot of people felt you had this coming but that lots just a bunch of bloody whingers i did this for fun, 1009
hoodwink, yeah with how fast you are you got no one to blame here but yourself i mean you could have been literally anywhere else, 1010

hoodwink, looks like im the king of mischief now, 1016
hoodwink, aw mate that kinda makes me need to go you know, 1017
hoodwink, heck with that singing voice it was either bolt or bolt her and i felt like staying, 1018

hoodwink, who doesnt like squishing bugs, 1022
hoodwink, yeah i got a fair bit of luck myself my uncle used to say i was right blessed you know on account of not dying like all my other kin, 1023
hoodwink, hey just what this place needed another selfrighteous metal marcher on some higher quest, 1024
hoodwink, wait wait i want to think of one you never heard before or after, 1025
hoodwink, yeah im not real keen on what you said about dying in a fire thats what my crossbow likes to call a trigger warning, 1026

hoodwink, bloody muppet what were you thinking, 1028
hoodwink, roll along home you silly bastard, 1029
hoodwink, i can hit anything doesnt matter how blurry, 1030
hoodwink, wouldnt it been better to die all peaceful like dangling a pole in the river not with two bolts in the dome, 1031
hoodwink, when i was just a little bit i used to wish upon shooting stars then i realized that was stupid and just learned to shoot instead, 1032
hoodwink, they used to tell stories about this one in the tomokan quite the little troublemaker thisll gain me even more respect, 1033
hoodwink, ugh uh the stench though how do you get that taste outta your mouth, 1034

hoodwink, now im the dodgy one, 1114
hoodwink, scurry out of it, 1115
hoodwink, its what i do, 1116
hoodwink, till recently i never had much interest in seeing my old home, 1117
hoodwink, who wants to see pacified lands when the stories of old are better, 1118
hoodwink, in the end it wasnt the idea of the place that took me scouting back but memories of my kin, 1119
hoodwink, i wondered if some might still be out there proper citizens of krimwohl now, 1120
hoodwink, it was enough to take me to the treeline anyway, 1121
hoodwink, even if i didnt find anyone worth seeing i was sure i could scare up a bit of good fun, 1122
hoodwink, shitty wizard, 1123
hoodwink, most of my life i thought my little sis carked it back on the night of fire, 1124
hoodwink, but a few seasons back i was tracking along the treeline near the pacified zone and, 1125
hoodwink, well id know that red tail anywhere, 1126
hoodwink, she was out with some sort of work crew, 1127
hoodwink, farming or some nonsense like there werent a world of food a few leaps away, 1128
hoodwink, i couldnt get two steps towards her less i wanted to light the place up, 1129
hoodwink, and i didnt even know if she remembered me she was hardly bigger than a biscuit back when, 1130
hoodwink, not the right move to reintroduce myself with a massacre probably, 1131
hoodwink, i watched for a spot to catch her out but the overseers kept a bloody harsh eye, 1132
hoodwink, then the whole bunch scampered off and i burned the crops, 1133
hoodwink, ive been back there now lotsa times but she hasnt far as i can see, 1134
hoodwink, i have seen some familiar faces amongst the work crews, 1135
hoodwink, and im sure i woulda known heaps a the others if all our lives hadnt gone up like a keg of powder, 1136
hoodwink, i always try not to hurt any of those types when i go in for a bit of fun with the guards, 1137
hoodwink, but anyone who tries to fight is fair game, 1138
hoodwink, i doubt we woulda been that close anyway, 1139
hoodwink, hoodwink, 1140
hoodwink, hoodwink, 1141
hoodwink, whats this then some kind of fight, 1142

void_spirit, yeeeesss ha ha ha ha ha ha haa, 645
void_spirit, yeeeesss ha ha haa, 646
void_spirit, you never understoodor even truly questionedwhy you were given this power, 647
void_spirit, nothing you could conjure in the material plane would have been enough to save you, 648
void_spirit, i once thought you might aid my cause in a much greater capacity than fodder, 649
void_spirit, the turstarkuri were consumed by their own folly they let themselves be slaughtered, 650
void_spirit, your masters misunderstood my teachings but their folly ends with you, 651
void_spirit, you thought you understood the true nature of this conflict fool, 652
void_spirit, your trail of victims means nothing to me axe you mean nothing to me, 653
void_spirit, i felt the ripples of your birth the consequences will end not with your death, 654
void_spirit, if your greatest ambition was to ride a bat you die not a failure, 655
void_spirit, is there a discernable difference between your kind and those you call beasts, 656
void_spirit, you concern yourself only with gluttony and this is where that path leads, 657
void_spirit, you see little of the path for one so concerned with tracks, 658
void_spirit, your potential has been dulled to the point of nothingness, 659
void_spirit, once you would have been a powerful ally, 660
void_spirit, i was surprised you could even comprehend my existence, 661
void_spirit, destroyed by the webs you yourself wove, 662
void_spirit, a life of constant battle can only end like this, 663
void_spirit, armageddon has lost a step or two, 664
void_spirit, i expected this i never thought to find an ally in one such as you, 665
void_spirit, you sought to control the world around you yet each choice led to here, 666
void_spirit, your curse is nothing to the void, 667
void_spirit, you donned the armor you met your end, 668
void_spirit, for a mortal to possess such power is quaint, 669
void_spirit, i could have shown you a way beyond the wall, 670
void_spirit, you come from a race of insects easily swatted, 671
void_spirit, the powers of the nothl realm are no secret to me, 672
void_spirit, you have wasted gifts untold crone, 673
void_spirit, the elements cannot hope to rein me in, 674
void_spirit, mortals fear you i do not, 675
void_spirit, i honor the power of the elder inside you, 676
void_spirit, you find your true tribe amongst the dead, 677
void_spirit, to deny my wisdom is to choose death, 678
void_spirit, tethered to this plane you accomplish nothing, 679
void_spirit, i could have been powerful friend to you earthshaker, 680
void_spirit, the creator falls like all the rest, 681
void_spirit, did you think i was one of your creations, 682
void_spirit, i alone see the way forward, 683
void_spirit, what is a flame burning in the void, 684
void_spirit, your actions endanger that which you swore to protect, 685
void_spirit, we could have accomplished much as allies enigma, 686
void_spirit, this will play havoc with the universe, 687
void_spirit, you understand the dangers that lie ahead and yet you stand against me, 688
void_spirit, sailing upon the ocean is not the same as swimming in the sea, 689
void_spirit, a petulant pursuit for power meets its proper end, 690
void_spirit, your inventions hardly lift you above the rabble, 691
void_spirit, this isnt your nothl playground, 692
void_spirit, you cannot escape me io our paths are linked, 693
void_spirit, there would be no arcane arts without the void, 694
void_spirit, i had hoped the wisdom of your kind would help you choose a better path, 695
void_spirit, from my perspective you met this fate only moments after the rest of your kind, 696
void_spirit, it brings me no pleasure to extinguish the first light, 697
void_spirit, the sea is a storm pond when compared to the void, 698
void_spirit, a better death than at the hands of a demon, 699
void_spirit, what other end could one such as you meet, 700
void_spirit, you certainly were a presumptuous child, 701
void_spirit, your tormented existence comes to a merciful end, 702
void_spirit, the soul of the slayer has been enveloped by the void, 703
void_spirit, hell has nothing on me, 704
void_spirit, your timeless history is a footnote in the scheme of the universe, 705
void_spirit, youd have wasted another span of years anyway, 706
void_spirit, your goddess doesnt care to help you child not that she could, 707
void_spirit, primitive magics, 708
void_spirit, noble creatures die the same as the wretched, 709
void_spirit, what does the word god mean to me pup, 710
void_spirit, there will be no justice for you, 711
void_spirit, you cant even grasp the true power of what you were given, 712
void_spirit, your titles mean nothing to me, 713
void_spirit, gods never fared well against you but i am not a god, 714
void_spirit, you were of great interest to me morphling perhaps in another life, 715
void_spirit, theres no one to hear you sing in the void, 716
void_spirit, living things die, 717
void_spirit, such a limited imagination you have, 718
void_spirit, you must learn to respect your elders, 719
void_spirit, your talents could have been leveraged for so much more, 720
void_spirit, the goddess of luck always was a moron, 721
void_spirit, would you like to know what the omniscience is purist hm hm hm hm, 722
void_spirit, it isnt prophecy so much as foresight and an excellent vantage, 723
void_spirit, the fall of the last guardian and no one left to recognize its import, 724
void_spirit, you fought well for a rolling ball of meat, 725
void_spirit, you would not have done well in my service i seek out a different kind, 726
void_spirit, your remnants will fade, 727
void_spirit, stars fall and then disintegrate, 728
void_spirit, this does not please me youngling, 729
void_spirit, without decay your life truly ends here, 730
void_spirit, i warned you not to interrupt me, 731
void_spirit, demons creatures of great power and limited intelligence, 732
void_spirit, ive broken your loop razor let it not start again, 733
void_spirit, i once thought a mortal unseen would be the most pleasant kind i was mistaken, 734
void_spirit, a great lineage comes to a nullifying end, 735
void_spirit, such regional concerns are beneath my time, 736
void_spirit, i dont waste my time with petty criminals, 737
void_spirit, your singular focus blinds you to the real matters at hand, 738
void_spirit, your magics were surprisingly powerful but your case was hopeless all the same, 739
void_spirit, you know nothing of silence boy, 740
void_spirit, your new queen wont even mourn you, 741
void_spirit, your depths arent nearly as black as the void, 742
void_spirit, small minds meet small ends, 743
void_spirit, you were not long for this world anyway but it is a shame about that wonderful dragontoad, 744
void_spirit, this is as kind a death as you could hope for small one others would do much worse, 745
void_spirit, this is a merciful end to your ceaseless wandering, 746
void_spirit, will your master show himself or must i seek him out again, 747
void_spirit, i misjudged your worth, 748
void_spirit, i was the first of us and i shall be the last, 749
void_spirit, you would have the same chance wielding a sharp stick, 750
void_spirit, you pose a danger only to those who are tethered to the earth, 751
void_spirit, after all that has been given still you cannot rise above your mortal ways, 752
void_spirit, the temple casts you out i shall find another, 753
void_spirit, that you were kept prisoner at all proves you were unworthy, 754
void_spirit, your god will need to find a new plaything, 755
void_spirit, the mortal mind is so easily brought to ruin, 756
void_spirit, the works of your life amount to nothing, 757
void_spirit, i would have called you ally tiny, 758
void_spirit, rest easy child, 759
void_spirit, your anger is useless here, 760
void_spirit, your bravery is noted its meaningless of course but i will remember, 761
void_spirit, i can go anywhere yet have invaded nowhere expand your ambitions, 762
void_spirit, your kind is lost on a grim charade, 763
void_spirit, you had no cause to die here, 764
void_spirit, was it not vengeance you desired you chose the wrong path, 765
void_spirit, youre larger than but somehow still less than a worm, 766
void_spirit, you still wouldnt have had a chance had you learned proper magics but it would have been closer, 767
void_spirit, my affairs do not concern you, 768
void_spirit, such ingenuity from such an insignificant brain, 769
void_spirit, it isnt possible to weave a fate untouched by the void, 770
void_spirit, i suspect some elemental loyalty may have been misplaced, 771
void_spirit, you had the power and the intellect yet let it come to waste, 772
void_spirit, your quaint magics were at least amusing to the eye, 773
void_spirit, your thirst for life amounts to nothing in the end, 774
void_spirit, it would have been unlike you to start making good choices now, 775
void_spirit, too ruled by fear and emotion to choose the winning side, 776
void_spirit, ill recall you as a minor inconvenience which is one step up from a pest, 777
void_spirit, you were true to your purpose i cannot deny, 778
void_spirit, your ancestors made interesting choices abbadon, 779
void_spirit, your talents are applied to such unworthy ends razzil, 780
void_spirit, have you knowledge of events to come kaldr, 781
void_spirit, some secrets lead only to ruin antimage, 782
void_spirit, your watch soon comes to an end warden, 783
void_spirit, each swing of your blade has been foretold axe, 784
void_spirit, what can you tell me of fear bane, 785
void_spirit, ive never had a nightmare only visions, 786
void_spirit, place our cause before your gods of gluttony bloodseeker, 787
void_spirit, you are welcome to our cause cousin but no drinking spirits in the temple, 788
void_spirit, you sense it too yes cousin, 789
void_spirit, if you stopped chasing perhaps hed stop running chaos knight, 790
void_spirit, you would be adrift without your ancient pursuit chaos knight, 791
void_spirit, youre new to eternity clinkz it gets better, 792
void_spirit, your life need not end trapped on this rock dark seer, 793
void_spirit, why do you seek the shadowgate amulet mireska i expect the toll of its use will not agree with you, 794
void_spirit, your father spends his wealth in search of my temple but such a path offers no purchase, 795
void_spirit, come brother theres much to be done, 796
void_spirit, your knowledge of this place will prove most helpful, 797
void_spirit, i have the answers you seek earthshaker come to me when the battle is over, 798
void_spirit, an eternity hasnt done any favors to your mood, 799
void_spirit, the moment is at hand brother theres much to be done, 800
void_spirit, we are not always in agreement but we can at least work in alignment, 801
void_spirit, i dont judge your hobbies enigma who am i to say whats abnormal, 802
void_spirit, i watched the evolution of your kind with great curiosity darkterror, 803
void_spirit, you have come by a power few mortals will ever know i wonder if its wasted on you, 804
void_spirit, i hardly remember a time before you io, 805
void_spirit, this battle can hardly start without the pair of us io, 806
void_spirit, im impressed that youve not only heard of the korumite but you even remember some incantations, 807
void_spirit, before i even knew myself i felt your headlong flight, 808
void_spirit, ive enjoyed watching your journey ezalor, 809
void_spirit, yes thats one way to look at the universe leshrac but id argue its a bit of a stretch, 810
void_spirit, demons you set your sights pretty low lion, 811
void_spirit, your goddess vouches for you so ill acknowledge your presence, 812
void_spirit, i dont mind your selfindulgence mars just so long as you keep swinging that spear, 813
void_spirit, the concept of royalty is rather amusing as are humans in general at least a queen bee serves a biological purpose, 814
void_spirit, youve provided much amusement wu kong its always entertaining to see divine arrogance brought low, 815
void_spirit, i serve no gods wukong i merely had later need of you and this version is much more useful, 816
void_spirit, your tastes are timeless night stalker i expect youll never change, 817
void_spirit, you could serve my interests well nyx should you choose to do so, 818
void_spirit, i have not gleaned what comes beyond this battle oracle is your sight the same, 819
void_spirit, does the old road go unguarded, 820
void_spirit, the high road may be lost to you assassin but there are other paths to follow, 821
void_spirit, some of the first visitors to my temple were ancestors of yours, 822
void_spirit, none of it truly matters skywrath try to let it go, 823
void_spirit, amusing that they call you an outlander, 824
void_spirit, we couldnt be more different yet were inextricably linked, 825
void_spirit, i warned you to follow my instructions to the letter, 826
void_spirit, i make no apologies for allowing thunderkeg to stumble upon that foribidden spell, 827
void_spirit, try to contain that wild streak for once and stick to the plan, 828
void_spirit, you have done well child now your true service comes to pass, 829
void_spirit, you do not recognize me lanaya but i am known to you all the same, 830
void_spirit, in some ways youre more alive than most mortals will ever be, 831
void_spirit, zeus i must say your attraction to mortals is puzzling, 832
void_spirit, shitty wizard, 833
void_spirit, crummy wizard, 834
void_spirit, i have never encountered a wizard who didnt bore me, 835
void_spirit, he he he he he he, 836
void_spirit, thank you, 837
void_spirit, thank you, 838
void_spirit, i feel gratitude, 839
void_spirit, there is nothing for you here there is nothing for you anywhere, 840
void_spirit, i must forgive you for being only what you are, 841
void_spirit, you seem to have trouble grasping cause and effect, 842
void_spirit, you must learn to live with the void inside, 843
void_spirit, surrender all hope to the void, 844
void_spirit, if you look long enough into the void, 845
void_spirit, embrace the infinite possibilities of the void, 846
void_spirit, even a god is nothing set against the void, 847
void_spirit, there is nothing outside the void, 848
void_spirit, the void is a mirror, 849
void_spirit, emotion is like any other tool easily mishandled, 850
void_spirit, the void is not absence the void is omnipresence, 851
void_spirit, how can you carry hope in the face of the void, 852
void_spirit, i will not harm those who do not stand in my way, 853
void_spirit, the wisdom of eternity guides my blade, 854
void_spirit, before there was the spirit there was the void before there was anything there was the void, 855
void_spirit, long after though only a moment in the scope of the whole there came a being of great power, 856
void_spirit, still without comprehensible form or voice of my own i felt this titans hammer fall and the four children scatter, 857
void_spirit, i began to find myself in the reverberations of the blow and i saw the expanse of time flash forth from the instant, 858
void_spirit, in that cascade of moments i knew i must learn to compose a form capable of interacting with the material plane, 859
void_spirit, those who see little think this battle to be the end of things, 860
void_spirit, for some it may be for others the fall of an ancient signals a fight of a different kind, 861
void_spirit, i sense distortions in the void, 862
void_spirit, something comes and none alone can stop it, 863
void_spirit, i have taken a form more able to interact with the matters of the mortal plane but i do not pass my time here, 864
void_spirit, to house this body and the artifacts it collects i long ago constructed a hidden bastion, 865
void_spirit, a temple fashioned after a korumite design far removed from the reach of all but those very few i permit to chance across it, 866
void_spirit, many do my bidding but none know my true face, 867
void_spirit, some amongst them are privy to a degree of wisdom while others remain blind, 868
void_spirit, i have seen everything just beyond this moment but there soon comes a point where i am blind, 869
void_spirit, i do not worry i have made every preparation for what i imagine lies ahead, 870
void_spirit, i do not enjoy how it feels to walk the mortal plane but mortals themselves can be quite amusing, 871
void_spirit, the decisions they make are nothing but astounding but how can they choose otherwise they cannot truly see, 872
void_spirit, i do not stop their scurrying if i can help it and if they get in my way their deaths will not be unkind, 873
void_spirit, the temple of the korumite monks was filled with scholars wise enough to study both the martial and arcane arts yet humble enough to know they did not possess the wisdom to correctly wield them, 874
void_spirit, very few mortals since have earned my respect like the korumite that barely a single soul remembers them is no small reason why, 875
void_spirit, soon the fabric of this realm will merge with others and the ripples of destruction will touch all planes equally, 876
void_spirit, there could be no arcane art were it not for the void while not the sole ingredient it is certainly a vital one, 877

snapfire, oh youre so spry even in my best days i couldnt pull that off, 1256
snapfire, shitty wizard, 1257
snapfire, crummy wizard, 1258

snapfire, you ought not to done that, 1263
snapfire, youd do best to stay on my sweet side, 1264
snapfire, and to think i was looking forward to this, 1265
snapfire, when mortimers around youre all playing second fiddle, 1266
snapfire, better skin my thumbbuster a bit quicker next time, 1267
snapfire, who wants cookies well too bad, 1268
snapfire, might be best to play a lone hand mortimer, 1269
snapfire, a body needs all the help she can get, 1270
snapfire, try some make ya feel right as rain, 1271
snapfire, dont you sass me, 1272
snapfire, this takes me back to my days as a road agent, 1273
snapfire, i aint gettin any younger, 1274
snapfire, they call that the snapfire special, 1275
snapfire, ill not be held responsible for gross incompetence on your part, 1276
snapfire, suck iron, 1277
snapfire, eat lizard chips, 1278
snapfire, ill refrain from profanity for mortimers sake, 1279
snapfire, oh give me a home where the wildwings roam, 1280
snapfire, you might be surprised how far a little kindness can go, 1281
snapfire, not everyone deserves kindness, 1282
snapfire, durana dung, 1283
snapfire, hornswoggle, 1284
snapfire, poppycock, 1285
snapfire, lowdown noaccount creepstealin fool, 1286
snapfire, damn you sons of bitches, 1287
snapfire, hellbear spawn, 1288
snapfire, oh stuff it, 1289
snapfire, people try to ask about my life story like they want a persons whole existence balled up into a dainty little yarn, 1290
snapfire, they wanna hear all about the bad beadie each one thinking that streak goes all the way back to being a wee girl, 1291
snapfire, sure i was a bit of a troublemaker but not all the stories they tell about me are true, 1292
snapfire, and i didnt really mean to run off just to go on a little adventure, 1293
snapfire, but one thing led to another a few months turned into a few years and before ya know it i was sucking down poisonmarsh water with a posse on my tail, 1294
snapfire, all over a very simple misunderstanding mind you which i can prove leastways i could have back then, 1295
snapfire, anyway by the time i made it through the marsh and lost those in pursuit it seemed easier to keep going than to turn back so i did, 1296
snapfire, oh i eventually made it back for a visit with my sisters and their respective broods but i was changed by then, 1297
snapfire, already met up with mortimer n dropped my bad ways and allways which i had only come to truly adopt after leaving home in the first place, 1298
snapfire, my point being the opinions of folk round here are somewhat unreliable, 1299
snapfire, the outlands are just what simpletons call all the lands beyond the dread marsh, 1300
snapfire, i havent even been to all of em far as i can see these here parts are the outlands, 1301
snapfire, theres a bigger world out there full of people that dont even know the battle of the ancients may well decide their fates, 1302
snapfire, but they can rest easy im on the job, 1303
snapfire, so yeah here ya call em the outlands but they all got names, 1304
snapfire, like praxacia thats my favorite krimwohl tho they can suck iron, 1305
snapfire, never saw any other folk like myself there were some with similarities but they didnt have much knack for tinkering, 1306
snapfire, so of course my wares were always in demand, 1307
snapfire, at first id sell to anyone buying principles dont get you out of a tight spotand i sure was in one after crossin the marsh, 1308
snapfire, course lacking convictions while simultaneously manufacturing weapons of mass murder is a purty good way to find yourself in cahoots with a bad bunch, 1309
snapfire, and me being me i found the worst, 1310
snapfire, we had a good run of years truth be told road agents arent known for longevity, 1311
snapfire, even the best gangs will fall to pieces from excessive death or infighting, 1312
snapfire, i wasnt needlessly cruel but i did get my hands dirty and i supplied armaments to folks who caused real harm, 1313
snapfire, while im sure theres something to learn from it most days i feel the less said about those days the better, 1314
snapfire, im not gonna lie i didnt know what i had when i first snatched this little feller up, 1315
snapfire, heck it was more of a joke n anything even givin him a name mortimer just a little nugget in my hand, 1316
snapfire, sure we all joshed i was his mammy but i really thought we were gonna eat him when he got a little bigger which he did rapidly, 1317
snapfire, wouldnt ya know it i fell in love with the big goof, 1318
snapfire, along with that feeling came some semblence of personal responsibility, 1319
snapfire, warnt long before me and the gang had a hard falling out, 1320
snapfire, but i got all the gang i need right here, 1321
snapfire, i later learned these lizards got quite the life expectancy, 1322
snapfire, so long as i dont get the both of us killed hell long outlive me, 1323
snapfire, but i know hell find someone else when im gone who needs his help just as much as i did, 1324
snapfire, and theyll be thankful to have him yep, 1325
snapfire, ive said it before ill say it a million times powder aint magic its art and the powder ganger is the artist, 1326
snapfire, i only really started making guns to ensure the quality of the smithing matched the quality of my pretty black dust, 1327
snapfire, you wont see a master painter scrawlin with a shopbought brush, 1328
snapfire, well once i had both the iron and the load i made my way with em, 1329
snapfire, selling em when i had or wanted to and turning em loose on those i thought deserved it, 1330
snapfire, but that was a long time ago now im more judicious in applying my talents, 1331
snapfire, a girls gotta have standards, 1332
snapfire, for a spell there i didnt want to have anything to do with smithing or killing, 1333
snapfire, but a keens idle hands are liable to rig up something even worse, 1334
snapfire, so i turned to baking cookies are my specialty largely on account of being my favorite, 1335
snapfire, but ride with me long enough and you might sample the odd snickerdoodle or taste some crumble pie, 1336
snapfire, i even found a way to apply some of my previous talents in whipping up an effective new recipe, 1337
snapfire, i do hope youll try some itll make ya feel right as rain, 1338
snapfire, its strange coming home one of my big sisters settled in the vale but thats all gone now, 1339
snapfire, her little snippers still runnin around but hes had a hard time of it, 1340
snapfire, i see some of the old keen around a bitthe ones that survived but theyre still scared of me like back in the day, 1341
snapfire, and while i do assert that their remembrances are a might exaggerated i will own up to a smidge of impropriety at a young age, 1342
snapfire, i was just trying to find my place in the world, 1343
snapfire, if they think i was bad back then i should give em a taste of what come after hehe, 1344
snapfire, anywho i dont know how long ill stick around, 1345
snapfire, theres trouble brewing and if ive learned anything a trusty iron on your side can make all the difference, 1346
snapfire, some folk are content just to have a roof over head n kin to hold but i gave all that up years ago yep got everything i need right here, 1347
snapfire, ive been around a few places n one thing i learned you got plans you got contingencies and you got the ace up your sleeve when the first two go belly up, 1348

mars, youre all playing my game now, 1136
mars, this is dooootaaaaa, 1137
dawnbreaker, i was created for one purpose, 0
dawnbreaker, to serve the children of light, 1
dawnbreaker, i never questioned, 2
dawnbreaker, but the ends they set me to had a dark nature, 3
dawnbreaker, darker than such golden creatures would ever let you think, 4
dawnbreaker, i was created to deliver ultimate power, 5
dawnbreaker, to help the misguided children rid the universe of darkness forever, 6
dawnbreaker, what is darkness and light chaos and order, 7
dawnbreaker, does chaos truly exist more in one than the other and order, 8
dawnbreaker, i used to think so as a righteous creation of light, 9
dawnbreaker, but the history of this vast expanse suggests otherwise, 10
dawnbreaker, i was shaped to serve the light to bend chaos to order and keep the darkness at bay, 11
dawnbreaker, until my masters set me upon an impossible mission, 12
dawnbreaker, to seize a power they knew to be unobtainable, 13
dawnbreaker, and the price of my failure was to watch all that was dear to me flicker into nothingness, 14
dawnbreaker, without enough strength left in my body to even look away, 15
dawnbreaker, for aeons the children kept my true purpose from me, 16
dawnbreaker, constantly setting me after new challenges prodding and testing me along the way, 17
dawnbreaker, i suspect now even they knew the price for failure of my final mission, 18
dawnbreaker, but if so how could they have ever sent me on my way, 19
dawnbreaker, how did i come to this world i have not been here long, 20
dawnbreaker, mere hundreds of your tiny lifetimes like yours spent mostly in slumber, 21
dawnbreaker, before that i floated through the cosmos near to lifeless, 22
dawnbreaker, passive and cold as the faded star from which i was shaped, 23
dawnbreaker, perhaps some force pulled me to this place, 24
dawnbreaker, or perhaps my derelict course through the cosmos just happened to intersect, 25
dawnbreaker, but given the stakes of the fight before us i put my faith in the former, 26
dawnbreaker, when i awoke here i knew not where i was, 27
dawnbreaker, my dreams spanned millenia and my eyes opened into darkness, 28
dawnbreaker, but somewhere on this world an ageless beacon flared to life, 29
dawnbreaker, a solar forge set alight by a wandering star one much too young for me to know its name, 30
dawnbreaker, and from this forge i began to draw some echo of the children of light, 31
dawnbreaker, whose very breathes formed the first essence of my life, 32
dawnbreaker, in those quiet centuries i dwelled upon my failures, 33
dawnbreaker, and lamented the loss of my gods, 34
dawnbreaker, but i was not created to dwell in darkness, 35
dawnbreaker, and the world around me could use my hammer still, 36
dawnbreaker, so i have risen to join the world of the living, 37
dawnbreaker, it does not matter if the children of light are mere memories, 38
dawnbreaker, this world has need of that memory and the light of the first stars lost though they may be, 39
dawnbreaker, the children of light were my everything, 40
dawnbreaker, but i cannot tell you much of how they came to be, 41
dawnbreaker, i know only they were descendants of the keepers first sun, 42
dawnbreaker, one of the earliest and most powerful branches of that nowvast lineage, 43
dawnbreaker, they worked as one but in the darkness they shone as many, 44
dawnbreaker, in the ages following my creation my nature was limited, 45
dawnbreaker, i fought for the glory of the golden ones, 46
dawnbreaker, nave to the lack of my own sense of self, 47
dawnbreaker, but i learned much during aeons of service to the children, 48
dawnbreaker, by the time of my fateful mission, 49
dawnbreaker, i think i should have known better, 50
dawnbreaker, i can hope i know better now, 51
dawnbreaker, valora, 52
dawnbreaker, valora, 53
dawnbreaker, valora, 54
dawnbreaker, the dawn star, 55
dawnbreaker, the dawn star rises, 56
dawnbreaker, the dawn star rises, 57

dawnbreaker, with enough strength i can end the fighting altogether, 257
dawnbreaker, filled with the energy of forgotten stars, 258
dawnbreaker, im almost 11000th of the way to my former self, 259

dawnbreaker, my wish is granted, 267
dawnbreaker, a step closer, 268
dawnbreaker, respectable gains, 269
dawnbreaker, im crushing it and them, 270
dawnbreaker, yours was a glorious end at my hand, 271
dawnbreaker, this is what happens when you stare into the sun, 272
dawnbreaker, you cannot stand this close to the heart of a star, 273
dawnbreaker, i was created to destroy beings much greater than the likes of you, 274
dawnbreaker, could you not feel my radiance you should have run, 275
dawnbreaker, you should never have stepped onto a battlefield against me, 276
dawnbreaker, the children of light have faded but i honor them with this kill, 277
dawnbreaker, i was made for greater things but someone told me to stop and smell the roses, 278
dawnbreaker, youre probably feeling some disappointment right about now, 279
dawnbreaker, a bittersweet sunset for you, 280
dawnbreaker, ive learned a lot about serving truth instead of light but in the end i was still made to hit things, 281
dawnbreaker, if you get another chance try to make better use of it, 282
dawnbreaker, dont sulk this was inevitable, 283
dawnbreaker, just beg for another chance in the afterlife i hear this place is pretty easygoing in that regard, 284
dawnbreaker, have you learned your limits or you just warming up, 285
dawnbreaker, its a beautiful day to keep teaching you lessons, 286
dawnbreaker, whos next ive got all day and then some, 287

dawnbreaker, dawn breaks into night, 290
dawnbreaker, may the light forgive me, 291
dawnbreaker, has my second chance reached an end, 292
dawnbreaker, the dark sleep beckons, 293
dawnbreaker, i join the children of light, 294
dawnbreaker, golden ones light my way, 295
dawnbreaker, creatures of darkness prevail, 296
dawnbreaker, this star fades once more, 297
dawnbreaker, my hammer falls silent, 298
dawnbreaker, who will carry forth the light, 299
dawnbreaker, the essence cannot be destroyed, 300
dawnbreaker, the sun sets on this station, 301
dawnbreaker, are you a god, 302
dawnbreaker, darkness quells my spirit, 303
dawnbreaker, without the children of light my strength is not enough, 304
dawnbreaker, i was not made for this, 305
dawnbreaker, let the light carry me away, 306
dawnbreaker, for a moment the darkness beckoned once more, 307
dawnbreaker, i will never return to the black sleep, 308
dawnbreaker, all right where were we, 309
dawnbreaker, ive been dead before its nothing to fear, 310
dawnbreaker, ill not leave my charge undone, 311
dawnbreaker, thats what i get for taking it easy on them, 312
dawnbreaker, sometimes i forget im not what i once was, 313
dawnbreaker, chaos will never take me, 314
dawnbreaker, one must always remember that the sun also rises, 315
dawnbreaker, mended once more like the battle never was, 316
dawnbreaker, i feel wonderful, 317
dawnbreaker, welcome to a brand new day, 318
dawnbreaker, i can shrug that off no problem, 319
dawnbreaker, the children of light grant me life once more, 320
dawnbreaker, the light fades only to shine again, 321
dawnbreaker, you played your part little one, 322
dawnbreaker, a bright flash in the glimmering darkness, 323
dawnbreaker, its perfect, 324
dawnbreaker, wonderful, 325
dawnbreaker, wonderful, 326
dawnbreaker, vast sums are made of insignificant amounts, 327
dawnbreaker, gold shines in the light, 328
dawnbreaker, this glory is not for me, 329
dawnbreaker, a small act for small minds, 330
dawnbreaker, what do such things have to do with me, 331
dawnbreaker, this is valuable to your kind, 332
dawnbreaker, nearly the color of a noonday sun, 333
dawnbreaker, crumble, 334
dawnbreaker, spill it, 335
dawnbreaker, next, 336
dawnbreaker, moving on, 337
dawnbreaker, denied, 338

dawnbreaker, merciful light, 353
dawnbreaker, did the sun catch your eyes, 354
dawnbreaker, you did not earn it, 355
dawnbreaker, is this enough, 356
dawnbreaker, what a strange custom, 357
dawnbreaker, its very difficult to find this in my size, 358
dawnbreaker, generally i prefer bespoke equipment but im in a rush, 359
dawnbreaker, a fine scepter, 360
dawnbreaker, perhaps the talents of this world are greater than i knew, 361
dawnbreaker, blink dagger, 362
dawnbreaker, short but useful enough, 363
dawnbreaker, a foul sensation but its use is plain, 364
dawnbreaker, aeon disk, 365
dawnbreaker, i bridge the expanse, 366
dawnbreaker, a boon for all who fight at my side, 367
dawnbreaker, a strange power one i will put to good use, 368
dawnbreaker, a measure of my old speed, 369
dawnbreaker, how could anyone refuse such a weapon, 370
dawnbreaker, battlefury, 371
dawnbreaker, all that remains of a wretched foe, 372
dawnbreaker, i love to trade, 373
dawnbreaker, will this work for me, 374
dawnbreaker, bloodthorn, 375
dawnbreaker, i wonder might these take me home, 376

dawnbreaker, well recharge on the go, 390
dawnbreaker, its funny i am a heart but ive never actually had one, 391
dawnbreaker, heavens halberd, 392
dawnbreaker, hurricane pike, 393

dawnbreaker, deadly orchid, 398
dawnbreaker, perserverance is a wonderful thing, 399

dawnbreaker, eye of skadi, 412
dawnbreaker, primitive but i welcome it all the same, 413
dawnbreaker, an interesting trinket but so limited in scope, 414
dawnbreaker, there is balance in this, 415
dawnbreaker, i seek to remember, 416
dawnbreaker, mortals the knowledge of the ages at their fingertips and they still misunderstand, 417
dawnbreaker, is there a first edition available, 418
dawnbreaker, not many things could make me say this but how degrading, 419

dawnbreaker, ive never saved something for later before, 435
dawnbreaker, a generous fate, 436
dawnbreaker, yes ive earned this, 437

dawnbreaker, i do not know the word surrender, 475
dawnbreaker, what does an ancients fall have to do with us, 476
dawnbreaker, all youve done is make the challenge a bit greater, 477
dawnbreaker, what right have you anyway, 478
dawnbreaker, victory, 479
dawnbreaker, victory, 480
dawnbreaker, in the absence of my gods i create new purpose, 481
dawnbreaker, more than restored i am improved, 482
dawnbreaker, with this power in hand perhaps chaos truly can be defeated, 483
dawnbreaker, i am whole again and more, 484

dawnbreaker, the lesson for you is never try, 570

dawnbreaker, what do such concoctions have to do with me, 588
dawnbreaker, youve lurked at the edges for too long i say no more, 589
dawnbreaker, why are mortals all so full of themselves, 590
dawnbreaker, die in peace warden i will see to the end of both ancients myself, 591
dawnbreaker, if i am to blame for your presence here then consider this my first act of contrition, 592
dawnbreaker, with such inadequate force you needed much better technique, 593
dawnbreaker, a novel creature i should have found a more imaginative way to kill you, 594
dawnbreaker, just so im clear which one of them was in charge, 595
dawnbreaker, this one was primitive even for this world, 596
dawnbreaker, come now your gods are but children playing in the mud, 597
dawnbreaker, i thought it might be novel if i kept you as a pet but who has the time for that, 598
dawnbreaker, if i were made of flesh parts id spend my day at drink as well, 599
dawnbreaker, i do not understand the evolution of one like this why would nature prefer such poor tactics, 600
dawnbreaker, by the stars that made a satisfying splat, 601
dawnbreaker, leave this one to the gods horse man, 602
dawnbreaker, in their greed to stop you my masters lost sight of everything today i make it right, 603
dawnbreaker, the golden ones were wrong we did not need io to bind you i was enough, 604
dawnbreaker, in my weakened state killing the elder is a great achievement, 605
dawnbreaker, something isnt right are you an imposter, 606
dawnbreaker, if i could have done this in a forgotten age what might have been, 607
dawnbreaker, perhaps i cannot escape the fates of my creation, 608
dawnbreaker, this is what i was made for but i take no pleasure in it now, 609
dawnbreaker, if only i knew how the golden ones planned to use your power, 610
dawnbreaker, poor invoker finally learned what a real sunstrike was all about, 611
dawnbreaker, give a mortal a little immortality and it goes straight to their head, 612
dawnbreaker, you could have saved your wayward progeny but you let them flicker and fade, 613
dawnbreaker, we dont need you anymore the spark has been thrown, 614
dawnbreaker, your goddess is nothing that you worship her makes you less than that, 615
dawnbreaker, for some reason i did not enjoy that as much as i thought i would, 616
dawnbreaker, i was born before your ancestors qualified as puddles of goo what is royalty to me, 617
dawnbreaker, im not a god im better than your gods, 618
dawnbreaker, you were not supposed to be gone this long, 619
dawnbreaker, the best disinfectant is always sunlight, 620
dawnbreaker, you lasted longer than most vermin but daylight comes, 621
dawnbreaker, definitely an argument against intelligent design, 622
dawnbreaker, youre a pale imitation of something grand, 623
dawnbreaker, enough with the wild goose chase, 624
dawnbreaker, if you would like to convert to a more righteous source of power just let me know abaddon, 625
dawnbreaker, which one of you would turn on the other first alchemist if it came to it, 626
dawnbreaker, convenient that youre here apparition lets fight after the fight, 627
dawnbreaker, so if this dead god wronged you antimage why havent you killed him further, 628
dawnbreaker, was it my transgression that freed your wards ancient gaoler the timeline seems to match, 629
dawnbreaker, as your muscles count for nothing with me axe what do you have to offer, 630
dawnbreaker, i wonder what the nightmares of worthy gods look like they probably dont have them, 631
dawnbreaker, tell me which lifeform is in control, 632
dawnbreaker, you have a lovely family karroch which one is your first born, 633
dawnbreaker, im sure youre a very skilled delivery boy bloodseeker, 634
dawnbreaker, is catching degenerates really so hard bounty hunter, 635
dawnbreaker, the effects of this drink of yours are wasted on me brewmaster, 636
dawnbreaker, please turn your back to your allies as well rigwarl your face is more pleasant that way, 637
dawnbreaker, the others seem to keep their distance broodmother is it because youre so fragile, 638
dawnbreaker, im sure the fighting prize you won is very valuable centaur the talent in the kilometers around your home must have been staggering, 639
dawnbreaker, i have great respect for the rules of teamwork otherwise youd be so dead right now, 640
dawnbreaker, its difficult to wrap my mind around working with you but i do it for the greater good, 641
dawnbreaker, do you have any friends not compelled to stay with you chen, 642
dawnbreaker, consider yourself lucky clinkz even the brightest of stars eventually burn away, 643
dawnbreaker, its amazing how effective your rudimentary armor really is clockwerk, 644
dawnbreaker, im not sure why the others call you stupid there is strange wisdom in your eyes, 645
dawnbreaker, im sure your sacrifice will be remembered for at least half of one generation dark seer ive seen much worse, 646
dawnbreaker, so the rebellious teenager act you studied this or are you just a natural, 647
dawnbreaker, it was very resourceful of you to turn your deficiencies into strengths dazzle, 648
dawnbreaker, yes i can see why you would yearn for death prophet, 649
dawnbreaker, youve managed to harness a great measure of power with such limited capacity, 650
dawnbreaker, very impressive wings doom its an unusual design no, 651
dawnbreaker, how did the other dragon knights respond to your ironic failure, 652
dawnbreaker, do not feel down ranger all mortals are hideous not just you, 653
dawnbreaker, youre much younger than inai i gather, 654
dawnbreaker, if we win this i can definitely help you with your travel plans earthshaker, 655
dawnbreaker, i see your attitude hasnt changed titan, 656
dawnbreaker, i know your eldest brother but i dont believe the two of us have had the pleasure, 657
dawnbreaker, yours is an interesting design enchantress who created you, 658
dawnbreaker, at least there are a few familiar faces around here, 659
dawnbreaker, what is one of your kind doing in this place faceless one, 660
dawnbreaker, your name suggests terror but you seem quite happy to me, 661
dawnbreaker, its refreshing that even the old and infirm still play with childrens toys in this place, 662
dawnbreaker, even i can see the sadness behind your eyes little one, 663
dawnbreaker, i really love your weapontobody ratio, 664
dawnbreaker, your sparklers are very pretty huskar but the adults are talking, 665
dawnbreaker, its no excuse io but it was my nature to serve, 666
dawnbreaker, when i first awoke in this place i wanted nothing more than to kill you io but that cannot be the way, 667
dawnbreaker, my masters would have gladly destroyed you io i can no longer fault you for their demise, 668
dawnbreaker, a portion of your spells are quite impressive invoker, 669
dawnbreaker, i think i could get rid of that ice head for you with minimal trouble, 670
dawnbreaker, im the last of my kind too juggernaut the first as well, 671
dawnbreaker, great grandfather i am humbled by your light, 672
dawnbreaker, will you set this all to rights great grandfather if you only cared to remember how, 673
dawnbreaker, i wonder great grandfather do you even know what your children became, 674
dawnbreaker, im not made of anything from this place kunkka i wont corrode but i would sink, 675
dawnbreaker, theres no shame in enjoying battle tresdin some of us were made for this myself literally, 676
dawnbreaker, i think you need some alone time leshrac it did wonders for me, 677
dawnbreaker, cold and dark is out lich warm and bright is the flavor of the day, 678
dawnbreaker, this is one of those cases where its really hard to tell if this is a person or someones pet, 679
dawnbreaker, your goddess was just a dilution of a greater line lina in case you didnt know, 680
dawnbreaker, did i just hear you talking to your finger lion, 681
dawnbreaker, you must forgive me for thinking of the bear as primary but he is far more interesting than you, 682
dawnbreaker, the moon has nothing without the suns light luna selemene is the same, 683
dawnbreaker, youre looking at it strangely lycan youd be dead if you werent like this, 684
dawnbreaker, no im sorry you couldnt handle this hammer magnus, 685

dawnbreaker, your master was furious with your disappearance morphling i hope youve been having fun, 693
dawnbreaker, my masters almost agreed to send me looking for you once morphling but more pressing issues arose, 694
dawnbreaker, you would be surprised how long it took for anyone in the universe to compose music naga, 695
dawnbreaker, its surprising trees dont hold more influence in these lands, 696
dawnbreaker, you seem to be putting quite a sheen on a fairly bad deal, 697
dawnbreaker, im surprised you havent slithered away to whatever hole you hide in when day breaks, 698
dawnbreaker, this ones not much for words but the first beings i interacted with didnt even have mouths so im used to it, 699
dawnbreaker, if youre playing the odds shouldnt there be a chance for failure as well, 700
dawnbreaker, after the fight show me this omniscience i have an inkling of what it might be, 701
dawnbreaker, it seems a lot of the others say very nasty things about you, 702
dawnbreaker, my old masters tried to manipulate fate it cost them, 703
dawnbreaker, i did not think to find one of your kind here watcher are there more of you to call on, 704
dawnbreaker, what a silly creature i like you, 705
dawnbreaker, were you never curious about your true parents i may know a means to find them, 706
dawnbreaker, it must be nice to know youll always have company, 707
dawnbreaker, thank you young one without your light the solar forge would have never called to me, 708
dawnbreaker, i am honored to fight by your side little lord you might say i was made for it, 709
dawnbreaker, were i still beholden to such things you would be my master now given the circumstances, 710
dawnbreaker, the golden ones would marvel at you young lord you carry their spark in you still, 711

dawnbreaker, in a way its like looking in a mirror though youre just a baby, 719
dawnbreaker, how do you plan to outlast this planet sand king, 720
dawnbreaker, your copies are amusing though i feel a bit melancholy, 721
dawnbreaker, demons get a lot of unjustified credit on the cleverness scale generally, 722
dawnbreaker, in a relative sense even the gods of this realm mostly employ carnival tricks, 723
dawnbreaker, you do the quiet thing and ill do my thing, 724
dawnbreaker, if you include other planets your other options are endless its time to move on, 725
dawnbreaker, ive spent far more time in a vacuum than in the depths, 726
dawnbreaker, prison is a novel concept tell me about it, 727
dawnbreaker, i guess its wise to carry a snack on your back, 728
dawnbreaker, i have a soft spot for primitive projectiles sniper, 729
dawnbreaker, are you tuning in or tuning out spectre, 730
dawnbreaker, this is why i would prefer to go by my proper name, 731
dawnbreaker, for how long inai has been sentient the rest of you seem fairly immature, 732
dawnbreaker, swords arent really my thing but yours isnt so bad, 733
dawnbreaker, its amazing techies youre so annoying even gods fear you, 734
dawnbreaker, your master is worthy of service are you worthy of serving him, 735
dawnbreaker, why does everyone around here have such small dreams, 736
dawnbreaker, most of the deities you worship in these parts are more like demigods than actual gods, 737
dawnbreaker, do you want some tips on mental fortitude timbersaw, 738
dawnbreaker, no you cannot examine me tinker im not a machine im beyond you, 739

dawnbreaker, i admire your zeal even if your goals are small, 743
dawnbreaker, if i give you the coordinates can you take us somewhere or do you need to know it yourself, 744

dawnbreaker, how do the normal bears compete for resources with you, 746
dawnbreaker, did you ask any of the powerful gods before settling for screeauk, 747
dawnbreaker, they make fun of your appearance venomancer but your features are quite common for this universe, 748
dawnbreaker, its interesting your lack of sophistication makes you dangerous, 749
dawnbreaker, your creators purpose does not need to be your own visage dont take as long to learn that as i did, 750
dawnbreaker, youve grown old inai was that intentional, 751
dawnbreaker, when do you plan to move onto the real magic warlock youve probably studied the practice spells enough, 752

dawnbreaker, youre a bit more than the average mortal windranger almost measurably, 754
dawnbreaker, i dont understand what youre asking wyvern why would i want to hear your poetry, 755
dawnbreaker, im curious how survival of the fittest resulted in you witch doctor, 756
dawnbreaker, ive been around for a while ostarion and i really dont think youve got what it takes to handle everlasting life, 757
dawnbreaker, i can relate to your story halfgod i was once mighty too, 758

muerta, welcome but unnecessary, 495
muerta, one more step down this dark path, 496
muerta, a beguiling light, 497
muerta, i thought that would feel better, 498

muerta, weve earned nothing less, 512
muerta, what should i make of this, 513
muerta, we shame the memories of my kin, 514
muerta, deafeated but never dead, 515
muerta, i still have my guns, 516
muerta, seek solace in the spirits, 517
muerta, i just have one parting thought, 518
muerta, i always kill quickly you dont need to beg, 519
muerta, you begged for mercy you have it, 520
muerta, i have shown you mercy, 521
muerta, mercy is yours, 522
muerta, mercy has been given to you, 523
muerta, mercy comes easy grace demands more, 524
muerta, i promise you a quick death the eternity of torment waiting for you in the afterlife might take a bit longer, 525
muerta, i call this one mercy and this one grace i offer them to anyone who needs it, 526
muerta, what do you want to lose first body or soul, 527
muerta, i call my girls mercy and grace and ill show you both, 528
muerta, ill show you mercy youve earned it, 529
muerta, i will show you grace you deserve it, 530

muerta, top is missing, 534
muerta, middle is missing, 535
muerta, bottom is missing, 536
muerta, the story of my life my death is not for the ears of a stranger, 537
muerta, the story of my life my death is not for you, 538
muerta, join the other fools make up whatever tales that you like, 539
muerta, if that proves not enough find your answers with the reaper of souls, 540
muerta, i can arrange a meeting if youd like, 541
muerta, for the living death and destruction appear as agents of chaos, 542
muerta, but no matter the means of passing there are strict rules to the structures of the afterlife, 543
muerta, when my family and i were murdered i knew enough to win a second chance, 544
muerta, but rules play both ways, 545
muerta, when i demanded my family return with me, 546
muerta, the reaper chided we only play the game of souls for one, 547
muerta, my loved ones were bound beyond the veil forever, 548
muerta, i alone was free to return home, 549
muerta, to find vengeance to live a mortal life, 550
muerta, i thought i knew pain and hatred, 551
muerta, but as rich as human life is there are depths of suffering and malice unknown to the living, 552
muerta, take heart warm ones some truths in this world only the damned can tell, 553
muerta, but id had a life my family taken from me, 554
muerta, vengeance alone i needed from the mortal realm, 555
muerta, instead i struck a bargain, 556
muerta, my eternal services in exchange for a means to seek retribution and see my kin, 557
muerta, to share the reapers burdens walk in both worlds, 558
muerta, haunt the lands of the living and stalk the trails of the damned, 559
muerta, one pistol to destroy the body the other to claim the soul, 560
muerta, i lived my death once i do not need to live it again, 561
muerta, not for your amusement, 562
muerta, why not amuse ourselves with fairytales instead, 563
muerta, some of what they say about me is diverting, 564
muerta, others not so much, 565
muerta, i have no master but i pay my debts well, 566
muerta, nothing too complicated, 567
muerta, chasing down a few wayward souls, 568
muerta, hardly the first bounties ive collected, 569
muerta, but those are tales from another life, 570
muerta, all but one of those who wronged me are long departed, 571
muerta, but the fruits of that lineage still bear seed, 572
muerta, soon i will destroy the last of that line and no more will grow to replace them, 573
muerta, when they came for my family they were thorough, 574

muerta, i thought that would feel better, 1383

muerta, we shame the memories of my kin, 1399
muerta, deafeated but never dead, 1400
muerta, i still have my guns, 1401
muerta, seek solace in the spirits, 1402
muerta, i just have one parting thought, 1403
muerta, i always kill quickly you dont need to beg, 1404
muerta, you begged for mercy you have it, 1405
muerta, i have shown you mercy, 1406
muerta, mercy is yours, 1407
muerta, mercy has been given to you, 1408
muerta, mercy comes easy grace demands more, 1409
muerta, i promise you a quick death the eternity of torment waiting for you in the afterlife might take a bit longer, 1410
muerta, i call this one mercy and this one grace i offer them to anyone who needs it, 1411
muerta, what do you want to lose first body or soul, 1412
muerta, i call my girls mercy and grace and ill show you both, 1413
muerta, ill show you mercy youve earned it, 1414
muerta, i will show you grace you deserve it, 1415
muerta, i call my guns mercy and grace and ill show you both, 1416
muerta, i am happy to show grace and mercy to everyone here, 1417
muerta, anyone deserving of grace and mercy theyre both right here, 1418
muerta, top is missing, 1419
muerta, middle is missing, 1420
muerta, bottom is missing, 1421
muerta, the story of my life my death is not for the ears of a stranger, 1422
muerta, the story of my life my death is not for you, 1423
muerta, join the other fools make up whatever tales that you like, 1424
muerta, if that proves not enough find your answers with the reaper of souls, 1425
muerta, i can arrange a meeting if youd like, 1426
muerta, for the living death and destruction appear as agents of chaos, 1427
muerta, but no matter the means of passing there are strict rules to the structures of the afterlife, 1428
muerta, when my family and i were murdered i knew enough to win a second chance, 1429
muerta, but rules play both ways, 1430
muerta, when i demanded my family return with me, 1431
muerta, the reaper chided we only play the game of souls for one, 1432
muerta, my loved ones were bound beyond the veil forever, 1433
muerta, i alone was free to return home, 1434
muerta, to find vengeance to live a mortal life, 1435
muerta, i thought i knew pain and hatred, 1436
muerta, but as rich as human life is there are depths of suffering and malice unknown to the living, 1437
muerta, take heart warm ones some truths in this world only the damned can tell, 1438
muerta, but id had a life my family taken from me, 1439
muerta, vengeance alone i needed from the mortal realm, 1440
muerta, instead i struck a bargain, 1441
muerta, my eternal services in exchange for a means to seek retribution and see my kin, 1442
muerta, to share the reapers burdens walk in both worlds, 1443
muerta, haunt the lands of the living and stalk the trails of the damned, 1444
muerta, one pistol to destroy the body the other to claim the soul, 1445
muerta, i lived my death once i do not need to live it again, 1446
muerta, not for your amusement, 1447
muerta, why not amuse ourselves with fairytales instead, 1448
muerta, some of what they say about me is diverting, 1449
muerta, others not so much, 1450
muerta, i have no master but i pay my debts well, 1451
muerta, nothing too complicated, 1452
muerta, chasing down a few wayward souls, 1453
muerta, hardly the first bounties ive collected, 1454
muerta, but those are tales from another life, 1455
muerta, all but one of those who wronged me are long departed, 1456
muerta, but the fruits of that lineage still bear seed, 1457
muerta, soon i will destroy the last of that line and no more will grow to replace them, 1458
muerta, when they came for my family they were thorough, 1459
muerta, none were left alive, 1460
muerta, except for me, 1461
muerta, i clung to life not for lifes sake but for hate, 1462
muerta, i would have my revenge, 1463
muerta, thats where death found me, 1464
muerta, clinging to my lifethread, 1465
muerta, my refusal to die impressed him, 1466
muerta, so death offered me a bargain, 1467
muerta, i can cross the spirit veil and see my family, 1468
muerta, and in exchange i track down souls that do not want to be found, 1469
muerta, to do that death gave me these, 1470
muerta, i call them mercy and grace, 1471
muerta, i am happy to show them to you any time you wish, 1472
muerta, my story begins a thousand ways, 1473
muerta, but the end is always the same, 1474
muerta, death offered me a bargain and these guns, 1475
muerta, and i took them, 1476
muerta, an endless road, 1477
muerta, it seems ok, 1478
muerta, apparently so, 1479
muerta, phantom footsteps, 1480
muerta, a whisper on the wind, 1481
muerta, because i say, 1482
muerta, yes fine, 1483
muerta, its one option, 1484
muerta, come, 1485
muerta, why there, 1486
muerta, long have i stalked these lands, 1487
muerta, i miss my horse, 1488
muerta, i know this trail, 1489
muerta, go, 1490
muerta, theres always more to shoot, 1491
muerta, find the right moment to strike, 1492
muerta, a revelation, 1493
muerta, maybe its fate, 1494
muerta, im there, 1495
muerta, ill make the most of it, 1496
muerta, death comes, 1497
muerta, my guns abide, 1498
muerta, how was my family taken from me there are so many legends ive lost track, 1499

muerta, what fable of muerta were you told whatever cruelties youve heard the truth is far worse, 1502
muerta, whatever atrocities you think you heard about me i assure you i committed them and worse, 1503
muerta, the story of muerta a comforting fairy tale for imbeciles and children, 1504
muerta, if you want to know what happened to my family you are welcome to ask them yourself, 1505
muerta, i do not talk about my family they are safe from the evil of the world, 1506
muerta, i guess i could tell you what happened to my family im going to kill you anyway, 1507
muerta, you want to know what happened to my family look down this barrel, 1508
muerta, if you want to know who killed my family ask them yourself im happy to arrange the meeting, 1509
